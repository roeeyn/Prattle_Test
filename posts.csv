<p>We are working to tackle vaccine misinformation on Facebook by reducing its distribution and providing people with authoritative information on the topic. We are starting by taking a series of steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will reduce the ranking of groups and Pages that spread misinformation about vaccinations in News Feed and Search. These groups and Pages will not be included in recommendations or in predictions when you type into Search.</li>
<li>When we find ads that include misinformation about vaccinations, we will reject them. We also removed related targeting options, like “vaccine controversies.” For ad accounts that continue to violate our policies, we may take further action, such as disabling the ad account.</li>
<li>We won’t show or recommend content that contains misinformation about vaccinations on Instagram Explore or hashtag pages.</li>
<li>We are exploring ways to share educational information about vaccines when people come across misinformation on this topic.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How This Will Work</b></p>
<p>Leading global health organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have publicly identified verifiable vaccine hoaxes. If these vaccine hoaxes appear on Facebook, we will take action against them.</p>
<p>For example, if a group or Page admin posts this vaccine misinformation, we will exclude the entire group or Page from recommendations, reduce these groups and Pages’ distribution in News Feed and Search, and reject ads with this misinformation.</p>
<p>We also believe in providing people with additional context so they can decide whether to read, share, or engage in conversations about information they see on Facebook. We are exploring ways to give people more accurate information from expert organizations about vaccines at the top of results for related searches, on Pages discussing the topic, and on invitations to join groups about the topic. We will have an update on this soon.</p>
<p>We are fully committed to the safety of our community and will continue to expand on this work.</p>

<p><i>By Nathaniel Gleicher, Head of Cybersecurity Policy</i></p>
<p>Today we removed multiple Pages, groups and accounts that engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior on Facebook and Instagram. The two domestic operations we found originated in the UK and Romania. We didn’t find any links between these sets of activities, but they used similar tactics by creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing.</p>
<p>We are constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don’t want our services to be used to manipulate people. We’re taking down these Pages and accounts based on their behavior, not the content they posted. In each of these cases, the people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, and that was the basis for our action.</p>
<p>While we are making progress rooting out this abuse, as we’ve said before, it’s an ongoing challenge because the people responsible are determined and well funded. We constantly have to improve to stay ahead. That means building better technology, hiring more people and working more closely with law enforcement, security experts and other companies. Their collaboration was critical to these investigations.</p>
<p>We’ll update this post with more details when we have them, or if the facts change.</p>
<p><b>What We’ve Found So Far</b></p>
<p><b>Today we removed 137 Facebook and Instagram accounts, Pages and Groups for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior as part of a domestic-focused network in the UK.</b> The individuals behind these accounts represented themselves as far-right and anti-far-right activists, frequently changed Page and Group names, and operated fake accounts to engage in hate speech and spread divisive comments on both sides of the political debate in the UK. Despite their misrepresentation of their identities, we found that these Pages, Groups and accounts were connected. They frequently posted about local and political news including topics like immigration, free speech, racism, LGBT issues, far-right politics, issues between India and Pakistan, and religious beliefs including Islam and Christianity.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Presence on Facebook and Instagram:</i> 23 Pages, 74 Facebook accounts, 5 Groups, and 35 Instagram accounts.</li>
<li><i>Followers:</i><i> </i>About 175,000 accounts followed one or more of these Pages, and around 4,500 accounts followed one or more of these Instagram accounts.</li>
<li><i>Advertising:</i> Around $1,500 in spending for ads on Facebook paid for in US dollars and GB pounds. The first ad ran in December 2013, and the most recent ad ran in October 2018. We have not completed a review of the organic content coming from these accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>We identified these accounts and Pages through an internal investigation into UK-linked coordinated inauthentic behavior. Our assessment benefited from reporting by UK law enforcement. We have shared information about our analysis back with law enforcement, policymakers in the UK, and our industry partners.</p>

<p><b>Separately, we also removed 31 Facebook Pages, Groups, and accounts for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior as part of a network that operated in Romania and used a combination of fake accounts and some authentic accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing. </b>The Page admins and account owners typically posted about local news and political issues, including partisan news under fictitious bylines in support of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). They also shared divisive narratives and promoted content hosted by several domains that present themselves as news sites. Although the people behind this activity attempted to conceal their identities, our manual review found that some of this activity was linked to an individual associated with the PSD.</p>

<p>Today, Mark Zuckerberg outlined Facebook’s vision and principles around building a privacy-focused messaging and social networking platform:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa""><strong>Private interactions</strong>. People should have simple, intimate places where they have clear control over who can communicate with them and confidence that no one else can access what they share.</li>
<li class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa""><strong>Encryption</strong>. People’s private communications should be secure. End-to-end encryption prevents anyone — including us — from seeing what people share on our services.</li>
<li class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa""><strong>Reducing Permanence</strong>. People should be comfortable being themselves, and should not have to worry about what they share coming back to hurt them later. So we won’t keep messages or stories around for longer than necessary to deliver the service or longer than people want them.</li>
<li class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa""><strong>Safety</strong>. People should expect that we will do everything we can to keep them safe on our services within the limits of what’s possible in an encrypted service.</li>
<li class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa""><strong>Interoperability</strong>. People should be able to use any of our apps to reach their friends, and they should be able to communicate across networks easily and securely.</li>
<li class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa""><strong>Secure data storage</strong>. People should expect that we won’t store sensitive data in countries with weak records on human rights like privacy and freedom of expression in order to protect data from being improperly accessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re committed to working openly and consulting with experts across society as we develop this. You can read Mark’s full note below.</p>

3,"March 4, 2019","<div class=""post-content"">
<p><i>By Clair Deevy, Director of Community Affairs, Asia Pacific</i></p>
<p>Today we’re launching <a href=""https://wethinkdigital.fb.com/"">We Think Digital</a>, an online education portal with interactive tutorials aimed at helping people think critically and share thoughtfully online. We designed the program in partnership with experts from across Asia Pacific, and aim to train 1 million people across 8 countries in Asia Pacific by 2020, with our resources available in 6 different languages.</p>
<p>Asia Pacific has a fast-growing internet population, with more than 2.21 billion people now online and 203 million new people joining in the past year, according to We Are Social’s 2019 <a href=""https://wearesocial.com/global-digital-report-2019"">Digital Trends Report</a>. We Think Digital has been designed for new and existing internet users of all ages to develop the skills they need to safely enjoy digital technology, including critical thinking and empathy.</p>
<p>We’ve developed a series of online tutorials in collaboration with journalist Saffron Howden and with support from TJ Agulto from AHA Behavioral Design; Associate Professor Michael Dezuanni from the Queensland University of Technology; Professor Katherine Chen from National Chengchi University; Chairman Wayne Chau of the Agent of Change Foundation; Executive Director Hamish Curry of the Asia Education Foundation; and Dr Damien Spry, Lecturer of Media &amp; Communications at the University of South Australia and Visiting Fellow at Queensland University of Technology’s Digital Media Research Centre. These academics and representatives from NGOs and civil society organizations across the region all came together to address the question: what does it mean to be a Digital Citizen?</p>
<p>The topics covered include privacy, safety, security, digital discourse and knowing your digital footprint. The four modules are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What Is the Internet?</b> An explanation of the internet and social media, how they work, and the importance of digital citizenship.</li>
<li><b>Your Digital Footprint</b>: All you need to know about safety and security online and managing your digital footprint.</li>
<li><b>Be a Critical Thinker</b>: Helping you to discern different types of information and develop critical thinking and empathy when communicating online.</li>
<li><b>You as a Digital Citizen:</b> Insights into digital discourse and the differences between interacting online versus offline, your rights and responsibilities, as well as internet concepts like netiquette, being a creator, copyright and plagiarism.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re launching this program in Singapore first, before rolling it out to the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan. We also plan to bring this program beyond Asia Pacific to Argentina and Mexico. In Singapore, the program is supported by <a href=""https://www.pa.gov.sg/"">The People’s Association</a>, an organization which works to bring Singaporeans from all walks of life together through community programs. We are also forming a regional Steering Committee, whose role will be to advise Facebook on how to ensure We Think Digital can bring the most value to communities across Asia Pacific. The committee will comprise members from around the region, and its first two members are Dr. Vu Minh Khuong, Associate Professor at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore, and Dr. Pijitra Tsukamoto, Associate Professor at Thailand’s Chulalongkorn University.</p>
<p><b>Mr Chia Tze Yee, the People’s Association’s Group Director, Engagement Group said: </b>“Improving digital literacy and encouraging greater levels of digital citizenship benefits everyone in an increasingly connected community. The People’s Association recognizes the need to equip residents, especially seniors, with digital citizenship skills to exercise critical thinking and responsible online behaviour. We are happy to partner with Facebook to launch the We Think Digital initiative and are proud to be able to use our own ‘Seniors for Smart Nation’ programs and Silver Infocomm Wellness Ambassadors to help deliver these valuable skills to the public.”</p>

<p><i>By Katie Harbath, Public Policy Director, Global Elections and Ruben Hattari, Head of Public Policy, Indonesia</i></p>
<p>At Facebook, we’re focused on protecting elections while also making sure people have a voice in the political process. Over the last two years, we’ve learned from elections around the world to create a robust approach to safeguard our platform. This includes removing fake accounts, reducing false news, disrupting bad actors and increasing ads transparency. And we’re doing this while also supporting an informed and engaged electorate.</p>
<p>Today, we’re sharing more details on how we will protect the Indonesian elections in April.</p>
<p><b>Restricting Foreign Electoral Ads</b></p>
<p>Combating foreign interference is a key pillar of our approach to safeguarding election integrity on our platform. As part of this commitment, we’re temporarily disallowing electoral ads purchased from outside Indonesia ahead of the election. The restriction took effect this morning and will apply to any ad coming from an advertiser based outside of the country, if it references politicians or political parties or attempts to encourage or suppress voting.</p>
<p>We are using a mix of automated and human review to help us identify foreign electoral ads that should no longer be running on our platform.</p>
<p><b>Greater Transparency for All Ads</b></p>
<p>As part of our commitment to support an informed electorate, we’ve taken steps to provide more information about any ad a Page is running in the Page’s <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/transparency-for-ads-and-pages/"">“Info and Ads” section</a>. This includes electoral ads. People can also report an ad by tapping the three dots in the top right corner and selecting “Report Ad.” This section also offers more information about a Page, like when it was created and its previous names. This gives people a better understanding of the Page’s original purpose.</p>
<p>We’re also rolling out <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/01/elections-2019/"">a set of global political advertising tools by the end of June</a><a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/01/elections-2019/"">.</a> With each election, we’re learning which tools are most useful, so we can bring them to more countries, faster.</p>
<p><b>More Resources for Rapid Response </b></p>
<p>We are committed to tackling all kinds of inauthentic behavior and abuse on our platform — which we know often intensify during elections — from misinformation, misrepresentation and foreign interference, to phishing, harassment and violent threats. Our security team is working around the clock to help us stay a step ahead and uncover abuse. Globally, we’ve removed thousands of Pages, groups and accounts that engaged in <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/inside-feed-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/"">coordinated inauthentic behavior</a> across our platforms. We are committed to making improvements and building stronger partnerships around the world to more effectively detect and stop this activity.</p>
<p>We’re also setting up an operations center in Singapore focused on election integrity ahead of key elections across Asia-Pacific. The center will be staffed by experts from Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, who will work cross-functionally with our threat intelligence, data science, engineering, research, community operations, legal and other teams. This center will work with our Menlo Park headquarters and in-country experts to serve as another line of defense against false news and misinformation, hate speech, voter suppression and election interference.</p>
<p>Our teams also work closely with lawmakers, election commissions, fact-checkers, researchers, academics and civil society groups to better integrate efforts on important issues related to election integrity.</p>
<p><b>Growing Our Capacity to Address Misinformation and False News</b></p>
<p>We also want to make sure people see accurate information about the upcoming election and the choices they’ll be making at the ballot box. That’s why we’ve taken steps — in Indonesia and around the world — to improve the quality and authenticity of information on our platform and fight false news. We do this in three main ways:</p>
<p>First, we remove content that violates our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards"">Community Standards</a>, which help enforce the safety and security of the platform. Then, for content that does not directly break our rules, but still undermines the authenticity of the platform — like clickbait or sensational material — we <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/05/inside-feed-reduce-remove-inform/"">reduce its distribution</a> in News Feed so less people see it. Finally, we inform people by giving them more context on the information they see. For instance, when someone comes across a story, they can tap on “<a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/inside-feed-article-context/"">About this article</a>” to see more details on the article and the publisher.</p>
<p>We also want to empower people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share. In Indonesia, we’re conducting the Think Before You Share school program in partnership with YCAB Foundation and Do Something Indonesia. Our goal is to educate more than 30,000 students, teachers and parents in seven provinces about critical thinking skills in the online world.</p>
<p>And through our Laju Digital program in East Indonesia, we’re training local government officials and community members in key digital skills.</p>
<p><b>Increasing our Safety and Security Efforts</b></p>
<p>We now have more than 30,000 people working on safety and security across the company, three times as many as we had in 2017. We have also improved our machine learning capabilities, which allows us to be more efficient and effective in finding and removing violating behavior. These improvements have helped in many ways, especially in our work to fight <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/inside-feed-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/"">coordinated inauthentic behavior,</a> where we’ve used a mix of technology and our expert investigators to search for and take down more sophisticated networks.</p>
<p>While these efforts are global, we also customize our work to individual countries based on research and threat assessments that begin many months before ballots are cast. This means we have safety and security teams working to identify and disrupt any information operations we find, including in Indonesia. We’re also providing safety and security guidance to help protect candidates and party Pages from hacking and impersonation. Like we do for all elections, we will be proactively monitoring for impersonation or hacked accounts.</p>
<p>We want to make it harder to interfere with elections on the platform, and easier for people to make their voices legitimately heard in the political process. We have dedicated teams working on every upcoming election around the world, including Indonesia.

<p><em>By Paul Grewal, Vice President and Deputy General Counsel, Litigation</em></p>
<p>Today, Facebook and Instagram filed a lawsuit in US federal court against four companies and three people based in the People’s Republic of China for promoting the sale of fake accounts, likes and followers. They did this on both Facebook and Instagram as well as other online service providers including Amazon, Apple, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter. We’re also enforcing our rights under US intellectual property law for their illegal use of our trademarks and brand.</p>
<p>By filing the lawsuit, we hope to reinforce that this kind of fraudulent activity is not tolerated – and that we’ll act forcefully to protect the integrity of our platform.</p>
<p>The lawsuit specifically asks the court to prevent these people and entities from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating and promoting the sale of fake accounts, likes, and followers on Facebook and Instagram</li>
<li>Infringing on our trademarks on their websites</li>
<li>Using Facebook branded domain names to operate their websites (i.e. cyber squatting)</li>
</ul>
<p>Inauthentic activity has no place on our platform. That’s why we devote significant resources to detecting and stopping this behavior, including disabling millions of fake accounts every day. Today’s lawsuit is one more step in our ongoing efforts to protect people on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

6,"December 28, 2018","<div class=""post-content"">
<p>Yesterday, The New York Times published an article about the way we moderate content on Facebook. We’ve been accused of being “ad hoc, ” “disorganized,” “secretive,” and doing things “on the cheap.” This couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>We welcome debate about how to help keep Facebook a safe place where people can express their ideas. But that debate should be based on facts, not mischaracterizations. Here’s where we disagree with the Times:</p>
<p><b>Our policies are public, not “secret” or “closely held.”</b><br/>
For years, we’ve published our Community Standards, the overarching guide that outlines what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook. <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/comprehensive-community-standards/"">Earlier this year</a> we went a step further and published the internal guidelines we use to enforce those standards. Anyone can view them at <a href=""http://facebook.com/communitystandards"">facebook.com/communitystandards</a>.</p>
<p><b>Our policies are carefully considered, not “ad hoc” responses.</b><br/>
The Times is right that we regularly update our policies to account for ever-changing cultural and linguistic norms around the world. But the process is far from “ad hoc.” We make changes to our policies based on new trends that our reviewers see, feedback from inside and outside the company, as well as unexpected, and sometimes dramatic, changes on the ground. And we publish the changes we make every month.</p>
<p>What the Times refers to as a gathering “over breakfast” among “young engineers and lawyers” is, in fact, a global forum held every two weeks where we discuss potential changes to our policies. It includes experts from around the world with deep knowledge of relevant laws, online safety, counter-terrorism, operations, public policy, communications, product, and diversity. Yes, lawyers and engineers are present, but so are human rights experts, people who have studied hate and extremist organizations, former law enforcement and other public servants, and academics. As part of this process, we seek input from people outside Facebook so we can better understand multiple perspectives on safety and expression, as well as the impact of our policies on different communities.</p>
<p>Last month we started <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/11/enforcing-our-community-standards-2/#forum-minutes"">publishing minutes</a> from these meetings, and early next year we plan to include a change log so that people can track updates to our Community Standards over time.</p>
<p><b>The people enforcing our policies are focused on accuracy, not quotas.</b><br/>
The team responsible for safety on Facebook is made up of around 30,000 people, about <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/07/hard-questions-content-reviewers/"">15,000 of whom are</a><a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/07/hard-questions-content-reviewers/""> content reviewers</a> around the world, as the Times updated its story to note. Contrary to what the story reports, content reviewers don’t have quotas for the amount of reports they have to complete. Reviewers’ compensation is not based on the amount of content they review, and our reviewers aren’t expected to rely on Google Translate as they are supplied with training and supporting resources.</p>
<p>We hire reviewers for their language expertise and cultural context — we review content in over 50 languages — and we encourage them to take the time they need to review reports. They work in more than 20 sites around the world, which resemble Facebook’s own offices, and they provide 24/7 support. As the Times notes, some reviewers are based in Morocco and the Philippines, while others are based in the United States, Germany, Latvia, Spain and other locations around the world.</p>
<p><b>We’ve taken a careful approach in Myanmar based on feedback from experts.</b><br/>
When discussing our efforts to curb hate speech in Myanmar, the Times incorrectly claims that a paperwork error allowed an extremist group to remain on Facebook. In fact, we had designated the group – Ma Ba Tha – as a hate organization in April 2018, six months before The Times first contacted us for this story. While there was one outdated training deck in circulation, we immediately began removing content that represents, praises or supports the organization in April – both through proactive sweeps for this content and upon receiving user reports.</p>
<p>This was one of <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/08/update-on-myanmar/"">several</a> <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/08/removing-myanmar-officials/"">steps</a> we’ve taken in Myanmar in 2018. Another covered in the story was <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/08/removing-myanmar-officials/"">our decision</a> to remove Facebook accounts belonging to senior military officials in Myanmar without notifying the government. We did this based on guidance from international experts, who cautioned us as to potential reactions from the military, the blame that could be placed on the government, and the risk to people’s safety on the ground.</p>
<p>—<br/>
We play an important role in how people communicate, and with that comes an expectation that we’ll constantly identify ways we can do better. That’s how it should be. And it’s why we constantly work with experts around the world to listen to their ideas and criticism, and make changes where they’re warranted. Throughout 2018, we’ve introduced more transparency into our policies and provided data on how we enforce them. We’ve got more in store in 2019, and we look forward to people’s feedback.</p>

<p><i>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ngleicher"">Nathaniel Gleicher</a>, Head of Cybersecurity Policy</i></p>
<p>Today we removed nine Facebook Pages and six Facebook accounts for engaging in <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/inside-feed-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/"">coordinated inauthentic behavior</a> on our platform in Bangladesh. Through our investigation, which began in part based on a tip from Graphika, a threat intelligence company that we work with, we discovered that these Pages were designed to look like independent news outlets and posted pro-government and anti-opposition content. Our investigation indicates that this activity is linked to individuals associated with the Bangladesh government. This kind of behavior is not allowed on Facebook under our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/misrepresentation"">misrepresentation policy</a> because we don’t want people or organizations creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are, or what they’re doing. Here’s a breakdown of what we’ve found:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Presence on Facebook: </i>9 Facebook Pages, 6 Facebook accounts.</li>
<li><i>Followers:</i><i> </i>About 11,900 people followed at least one of these Facebook Pages.</li>
<li><i>Advertising:</i> Around $800 US dollars in ad spending on Facebook. The first ad was run in July 2017, and the last was run in November 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we have done with other investigations, we have shared our findings with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab. Here are some sample posts:</p>

<p><em>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Ime"">Ime Archibong</a>, VP of Product Partnerships</em></p>
<p>In the past day, we’ve been accused of disclosing people’s private messages to partners without their knowledge. That’s not true – and we wanted to provide more facts about our messaging partnerships.</p>
<p>We worked closely with four partners to integrate messaging capabilities into their products so people could message their Facebook friends — but only if they chose to use Facebook Login. These experiences are common in our industry — think of being able to have Alexa read your email aloud or to read your email on Apple’s Mail app.</p>
<p>People could message their friends about what they were listening to on Spotify or watching on Netflix, share folders on Dropbox, or get receipts from money transfers through the Royal Bank of Canada app. These experiences <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/technology/spotify-music-streaming-service-comes-to-us.html"">were</a> <a href=""https://mashable.com/2014/09/02/netflix-adds-facebook-sharing-controls/#RDPszYIF2PqH"">publicly</a> <a href=""http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/news/2013/20131211-facebook.html"">discussed</a>. And they were clear to users and only available when people logged into these services with Facebook. However, they were experimental and have now been shut down for nearly three years.</p>
<p><b>Why did the messaging partners have read/write/delete messaging access?</b><br/>
That was the point of this feature — for the messaging partners mentioned above, we worked with them to build messaging integrations into their apps so people could send messages to their Facebook friends.</p>
<p>Specifically, we made it possible for people to message their friends what music they were listening to in Spotify or watching on Netflix directly from the Spotify or Netflix apps (see screen shots below), to message links to Dropbox folders (like a collection of photographs) from the Dropbox app, and to message receipts from money transfers through the Royal Bank of Canada app.</p>
<p>In order for you to <i>write</i> a message to a Facebook friend from within Spotify, for instance, we needed to give Spotify “write access.” For you to be able to <i>read</i> messages back, we needed Spotify to have “read access.” “Delete access” meant that if you <i>deleted</i> a message from within Spotify, it would also delete from Facebook. No third party was reading your private messages, or writing messages to your friends without your permission. Many news stories imply we were shipping over private messages to partners, which is not correct.</p>
<p>These partnerships were agreed via extensive negotiations and documentation, detailing how the third party would use the API, and what data they could and couldn’t access.</p>

<p><em>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=678106196"">Konstantinos Papamiltiadis</a>, Director of Developer Platforms and Programs</em></p>
<p>Today, we’re facing questions about whether Facebook gave large tech companies access to people’s information and, if so, why we did this.</p>
<p>To put it simply, this work was about helping people do two things. First, people could access their Facebook accounts or specific Facebook features on devices and platforms built by other companies like Apple, Amazon, Blackberry and Yahoo. These are known as integration partners. Second, people could have more social experiences – like seeing recommendations from their Facebook friends – on other popular apps and websites, like Netflix, The New York Times, Pandora and Spotify.</p>
<p>To be clear: none of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people’s permission, nor did they violate our 2012 settlement with the FTC.</p>
<p><b>How did people use these features?</b><br/>
People used these features in many different ways, including through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apps that allowed people to access their Facebook account on their Windows Phone device</li>
<li>Notifications about their activity on Facebook that they could turn on while they were using Safari or other browsers</li>
<li>“Social hubs” that consolidated their feeds across Facebook, Twitter, and other services</li>
<li>Messaging integrations that allowed people to recommend things like songs from Spotify to friends</li>
<li>Search results in Bing and elsewhere based on public information their friends shared</li>
<li>Tools that helped them find friends on Facebook by uploading their contacts from email providers like Yahoo</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve been public about these features and partnerships over the years because we wanted people to actually use them – and many people did. They were discussed, reviewed, and <a href=""https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/how-to-opt-out-of-facebooks-instant-personalization/"">scrutinized</a> by a wide variety of journalists and privacy advocates.</p>
<p>But most of these features are now gone. We shut down instant personalization, which powered Bing’s features, in 2014 and we wound down our partnerships with device and platform companies months ago, following an announcement in <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/"">April</a>. Still, we recognize that we’ve needed tighter management over how partners and developers can access information using our APIs. We’re already in the process of reviewing all our APIs and the partners who can access them.</p>
<p><b>Who are these integration partners and why did Facebook work with them?</b><br/>
People want to use Facebook features on a variety of devices and products, many of which we don’t support ourselves. This was particularly true early in our history, before Android and iOS became the predominant ways people use the internet on their phones. Text-only and feature phones were widely popular. Across the industry, companies like Facebook partnered with other companies to build integrations. Take the Blackberry Hub app as an example. People using Blackberry devices could log into Facebook using this feature, allowing them to see the same Facebook News Feed they would see if they logged in from a desktop computer. The data we provided allowed the person to access their own account on Blackberry. Blackberry couldn’t use any of the information for its own purposes.</p>
<p>Facebook has had similar integration partnerships over the years with Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo and other companies, which were overseen by our partnerships and product teams. These partners built many kinds of integrations, including mobile versions of Facebook and social feed hubs, which aggregated feeds from Facebook and other companies. We’ve shut down nearly all of these partnerships over the past several months, except with Amazon and Apple, which people continue to find useful and which are covered by active contracts; Tobii, an integration that enables people with ALS to access Facebook; and browser notifications for people who use Alibaba, Mozilla and Opera.</p>
<p><b>Does this mean these companies got access to my Facebook information if I didn’t authorize it? </b><br/>
Our integration partners had to get authorization from people. You would have had to sign in with your Facebook account to use the integration offered by Apple, Amazon or another integration partner.</p>
<p><b>What was instant personalization and how did it work?</b><br/>
Instant personalization is a product we offered with select partners from 2010 to 2014 that involved public information on Facebook, and it’s different from the types of partnerships we’ve described above. With instant personalization, people could link their Facebook account with other services like Rotten Tomatoes or Yelp to see public information their friends shared. When searching on Bing for articles about an upcoming trip to Europe, you could get results based on what your friends had shared publicly. People could turn off instant personalization at any time.</p>
<p><b>Did partners get access to messages?</b><br/>
Yes. But people had to explicitly sign in to Facebook first to use a partner’s messaging feature. Take Spotify for example. After signing in to your Facebook account in Spotify’s desktop app, you could then send and receive messages without ever leaving the app. Our API provided partners with access to the person’s messages in order to power this type of feature. <em><strong>(Update on December 19, 2018 at 5:15PM PT: For more on Facebook’s messaging partnerships, see VP of Product Partnerships <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/facebooks-messaging-partnerships/"">Ime Archibong’s post</a>.)</strong></em></p>
<p><b>Why did some partners have access to data as late as 2017, even after instant personalization was shut down?</b><br/>
Instant personalization only involved public information, and we have no evidence that data was used or misused after the program was shut down. However, we shouldn’t have left the APIs in place after we shut down instant personalization. We’ve taken a number of steps this year to limit developers’ access to people’s Facebook information, and as part of that ongoing effort, we’re in the midst of reviewing all our APIs and the partners who can access them. This is important work that builds on our existing systems that track APIs and control who can access to them.</p>

<p><em>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sheryl"">Sheryl Sandberg</a>, Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Earlier this year, we launched <u><a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/11/facebook-community-boost/"">Facebook Community Boost</a></u>. We’ve now visited 50 cities across the country, offering digital skills training to small businesses and job seekers. We started in St. Louis in March and I’m excited that this week we’re hosting the final event of the year in my hometown – Miami.</p>
<p>We want to make sure no one is left behind in an economy where digital skills are critical. Over the next three days, we’re offering trainings on everything from getting online for the first time to creating content for mobile devices. Experts will be on hand to answer questions one-on-one and the event is free for everyone to attend at the James L. Knight Center (400 SE 2nd Ave, 3rd Floor) today through Thursday.</p>
<p>Through Community Boost events like this one, we’re getting closer to our goal of training 1 million people in the US in digital skills by 2020. This year we teamed up with 20 community colleges and 100 organizations across the country to help reach as many people as possible. Here in Miami, we’re partnering with Miami Dade Community College to prepare graduates for careers in the digital world.</p>
<p>There are 90 million businesses on Facebook, the majority of which are small businesses. More than half of them say they’ve hired more people since joining Facebook. This is so important because small businesses create most of the jobs almost everywhere in the world. In Miami-Dade County, more than 82,000 small businesses employ more than half of the workforce. We want to continue supporting entrepreneurs in Miami even after Community Boost is over, so we’re providing the Miami Bayside Foundation with a grant to offer microloans to underrepresented small businesses.</p>
<p>We’re proud of how people are using our products to make a difference in their economies and communities — and we’re committed to helping even more people thrive.</p>
<p>You can register for Community Boost and stay up to date with the latest city announcements, news and program schedules at <u><a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__fbcommunityboost.com_&amp;d=DwMF-g&amp;c=5VD0RTtNlTh3ycd41b3MUw&amp;r=kgHHvzdb9AUlvGoTZAwqwA&amp;m=H-uMR9_luowIKL4HnxoS95xlL6vb4uZzQL_UGDs5Z9c&amp;s=0T2DLwA1Uog6oiigsEmcU67PWr1ubHXGcAOlukCFmkU&amp;e="">fbcommunityboost.com</a></u>.</p>

<p>Civil rights are core to American values of equality, dignity and freedom from discrimination. Advancing civil rights benefits all of us and is what we stand for as a people.</p>
<p>In May, we accepted the call to undertake a civil rights audit. We asked Laura Murphy, a highly respected civil rights and civil liberties leader, to guide the audit. After speaking with more than 90 civil rights organizations, today Laura is providing an important update on our progress.</p>
<p>Facebook is committed to working with leading US civil rights organizations to strengthen and advance civil rights on our service. They’ve raised a number of important concerns, and I’m grateful for their candor and guidance. We know that we need to do more: to listen, look deeper and take action to respect fundamental rights.</p>
<p>In these first six months, Laura’s work helped us build upon crucial election-related efforts such as expanding our policy prohibiting voter suppression. We updated our policy to expressly ban misrepresentations about how to vote, such as claims that you can vote using an online app, and statements about whether a vote will be counted. Other misinformation related to voting – including false claims of polling place closures, long lines, and wait times – is proactively sent to third-party fact-checkers for review. The revised policy also prohibits threats of violence related to voting or voter registration. As a direct response to feedback from civil rights advocates, we are focusing on voter suppression as a distinct civil rights challenge and will continue this work to be better prepared for future elections.</p>
<p>Two independent reports commissioned by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released Monday on the Russian Internet Research Agency’s use of technology around the 2016 election suggest that the IRA’s efforts had a disproportionate impact on communities of color.  We take this incredibly seriously, as demonstrated by the investments we’ve made in safety and security.</p>
<p>In addition to working to prevent voter suppression, we’re also building on our efforts to encourage voter registration and engagement. When people turn 18, and ahead of elections, we remind them to register to vote. We help them find their polling places and remind them to vote on Election Day. This year, we also added a feature that lets people ask their friends to join them in registering to vote. As a result of these efforts, Facebook and Instagram helped register an estimated 2 million people in 2018, according to our nonpartisan partner TurboVote.</p>
<p>We know we need to do more. Laura’s report includes areas where we can and should do better – and we’re working hard to address these concerns. We also announced when this process began that we’re engaging with the noted civil rights law firm Relman, Dane and Colfax, to provide legal analysis and advice. We will include information about their ongoing work in future updates.</p>
<p>The civil rights audit is deeply important to me, and it’s one of my top priorities for 2019. I’m committed to overseeing its progress and making sure that it is a well-resourced, cross-company effort. I’m grateful to all of the leaders and advocates who have contributed to the audit this year, and I look forward to continuing this important work with them in the future.</p>

<p><i>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/meredith.carden"">Meredith Carden</a></i>,<i> Head of News Integrity Partnerships</i></p>
<p>Today The Guardian published a story about our <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/hard-questions-fact-checking/"">third-party fact-checking program</a>. We’d like to provide a response, as the piece presents several inaccuracies, and is based primarily on the account of a single fact-checker who hasn’t been involved with the Facebook fact-checking program for six months. We provided information to The Guardian, but they chose not to include all of it.</p>
<p>We have been committed to fighting misinformation for years now and have strong relationships with our third-party fact-checking partners — we now have 35 partners in 24 countries around the world. We value our ongoing partnerships and the work that these journalists do, and we’re planning to expand the program to even more countries in 2019.</p>
<p><b>Ensuring Process Integrity and Avoiding Conflicts of Interest</b></p>
<p>Contrary to a claim in the story, we absolutely do not ask fact-checkers to prioritize debunking content about our advertisers.</p>
<p>In reality, here’s how fact-checking works: the primary way we surface potentially false news to third-party fact-checkers is via <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/inside-feed-misinformation-zigmond/"">machine learning</a>, which relies on a number of signals like <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/inside-feed-how-people-help-fight-false-news/"">feedback</a> from people who use Facebook and the number of comments expressing disbelief (e.g., “No way this is real!”). Fact-checkers then go through a list of this potentially false content and choose for themselves what to fact-check — they are under no obligation to fact-check anything from the list, and if they’d like, they can rate stories that Facebook hasn’t added to the list (which they often do). As soon as something is rated “false,” it is automatically de-prioritized in News Feed, and where it does appear, we’ll show <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/news-feed-fyi-updates-in-our-fight-against-misinformation/"">Related Articles</a> including the fact-checker’s article below it. These processes are automated.</p>
<p><b>Efficacy of Fact-Checking</b></p>
<p>Fact-checking is highly effective in fighting misinformation: when something is rated “false” by a fact-checker, we’re able to reduce future impressions of that content by an average of 80%. We also leverage these ratings to take action on Pages and websites that repeatedly share misinformation. We de-prioritize <i>all</i> content from actors who repeatedly get “false” ratings on content they share, and we remove their advertising and monetization rights.</p>
<p><a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/10/inside-feed-michigan-lemonde/"">Three new separate pieces of research</a> have all found that the overall volume of false news on Facebook is decreasing since we put our third-party fact-checking program and other anti-misinformation measures in place. We’re also providing independent researchers at <a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__techcrunch.com_2018_07_11_facebook-2Dindependent-2Dresearch-2Dcommission-2Dsocial-2Dscience-2Done-2Dwill-2Dshare-2Da-2Dpetabyte-2Dof-2Duser-2Ddata_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=5VD0RTtNlTh3ycd41b3MUw&amp;r=7vt4S1forpwVxsyOtG60lg&amp;m=glZzAoJs_VPRdB-Al6gmjveQu9SBOL37t-b_d6PiYtc&amp;s=oAfQt4H_UlOsyhNE1xE03shbcrgy4D6um1VDdloiUC0&amp;e="">Social Science One</a> with a privacy-protected data set that will help them study the effects of misinformation on social media and elections. This research may help us better measure volumes of false news — and our progress against it — over time.</p>
<p>We have heard feedback from our partners that they’d like more data on the impact of their efforts, so we’re starting to send fact-checkers quarterly reports that include customized statistics that reflect the work and impact of each fact-checker.</p>
<p><b>Safety of Journalists and Fact-Checking Partners</b></p>
<p>We take the safety of journalists seriously. Through the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/e/courses/journalists"">Facebook Journalism Project</a>, we provide online safety resources, including information on how to turn on two-factor authentication, manage privacy settings, block harassment, control location sharing, report abusive content and impersonation, and more. Our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/credible_violence"">Community Standards</a> on credible violence aim to protect journalists and other vulnerable people or groups. We remove content, disable accounts, and work with local authorities when we become aware of content that we believe poses a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to safety.</p>
<p><b>Fact-Checking Ratings</b></p>
<p>We share specific rating guidelines with our third-party partners, and we make these <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/publisher/182222309230722"">publicly available</a> so publishers and others have insight into our program. We’ve also started to provide safety training as part of onboarding our new partners, and we’re working to expand this to our existing partners as well.</p>
<p>Misinformation is an ever-evolving problem that we’re committed to fighting globally, and the work that third-party fact-checkers do to help review content on Facebook is a valued and important piece of this effort.</p>

<p><em>By Tessa Lyons, Product Manager</em></p>
<p>Facebook is about connecting you to the people that matter most. And discussing the news can be one way to start a meaningful conversation with friends or family. It’s why helping to ensure that you get accurate information on Facebook is so important to us.</p>
<p>Today, we’re announcing two changes which we believe will help in our fight against false news. First, we will no longer use Disputed Flags to identify false news. Instead we’ll use <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/04/news-feed-fyi-new-test-with-related-articles/"">Related Articles</a> to help give people more context about the story. <a href=""https://medium.com/facebook-design/designing-against-misinformation-e5846b3aa1e2"">Here’s why</a>.</p>
<p>Academic research on correcting misinformation has shown that putting a strong image, like a red flag, next to an article may actually entrench deeply held beliefs – the opposite effect to what we intended. Related Articles, by contrast, are simply designed to give more context, which our research has shown is a more effective way to help people get to the facts. Indeed, we’ve found that when we show Related Articles next to a false news story, it leads to fewer shares than when the Disputed Flag is shown.</p>
<p>Second, we are starting a new initiative to better understand how people decide whether information is accurate or not based on the news sources they depend upon. This will not directly impact News Feed in the near term. However, it may help us better measure our success in improving the quality of information on Facebook over time.</p>
<p>False news undermines the unique value that Facebook offers: the ability for you to connect with family and friends in meaningful ways. It’s why we’re investing in better technology and more people to help prevent the spread of misinformation. Overall, we’re making progress. Demoting false news (as identified by fact-checkers) is one of our best weapons because demoted articles typically lose 80 percent of their traffic. This destroys the economic incentives spammers and troll farms have to generate these articles in the first place.</p>
<p>But there’s much more to do. By showing Related Articles rather than Disputed Flags we can help give people better context. And understanding how people decide what’s false and what’s not will be crucial to our success over time. Please keep giving us your feedback because we’ll be redoubling our efforts in 2018.</p>

14,"December 19, 2017","<div class=""post-content"">
<p><i>By Antigone Davis, Global Head of Safety</i></p>
<p>Today we are announcing new tools to prevent harassment on Facebook and in Messenger – part of our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10154544292806634?qid=339663931&amp;mf_story_key=10103508221158471"">ongoing efforts</a> to build a safe community.</p>
<p>Based on feedback from people who use Facebook, as well as organizations representing groups who disproportionately experience harassment like <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/07/11/online-harassment-2017/?utm_content=buffer08d0c&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer"">women</a> and <a href=""https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/gender-society/internet-harassment-online-threats-targeting-women-research-review"">journalists</a>, we are introducing new features that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proactively recognize and help prevent unwanted contact like friend requests and messages when someone you blocked sets up a new account or tries to contact you from another account they control</li>
<li>Provide the option to ignore a Messenger conversation and automatically move it out of your inbox, without having to block the sender</li>
</ul>
<p>We already prohibit bullying and harassment on Facebook, and people can let us know when they see something concerning or have a bad experience. We review reports and take action on abuse, like removing content, disabling accounts, and limiting certain features like commenting for people who have violated our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards"">Community Standards</a>. People can also control what they share, who they share it with, and who can communicate with them. These new features for personal profiles give people additional ways to manage their experience on Facebook.</p>
<p><b>Preventing unwanted contact</b></p>
<p>We’ve heard stories from people who have blocked someone only to encounter the same harasser using a different account. In order to help prevent those bad encounters, we are building on existing features that prevent fake and inauthentic accounts on Facebook.</p>
<p>These automated features help us identify fake accounts more quickly and block millions of them at registration every day. However, sometimes a new account created by someone who was previously blocked might not get caught by these features.</p>
<p>We are now using various signals (like an IP address) to help us proactively recognize this type of account and prevent its owner from sending a message or friend request to the person who blocked the original account. The person who blocked the original account is in control, and must initiate contact with the new account in order for them to interact normally.</p>
<p><b>Ignoring messages</b></p>
<p>If someone is being harassed, blocking the abuser sometimes prompts additional harassment, particularly offline. We’ve also heard from groups that work with survivors of domestic violence that being able to see messages is often a valuable tool to assess if there is risk of additional abuse.</p>
<p>Now, you can tap on a message to ignore the conversation. This disables notifications and moves the conversation from your inbox to your Filtered Messages folder. You can read messages in the conversation without the sender seeing if they’ve been read. This feature is now available for one on one conversations and will soon be available broadly for group messages, too.</p>
<p><b>Working with experts</b></p>
<p>Facebook works with experts in a variety of fields to provide safety resources to people. For example, we’ve developed new <a href=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/a-guide-to-staying-safe-on-facebook.pdf"">resources</a> for survivors of domestic violence in partnership with the National Network to End Domestic Violence. This is in addition to our work with more than 150 safety experts over the last year in India, Ireland, Kenya, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Sweden and the US to get feedback on ways we can improve.</p>
<p>We have also convened roundtables with the <a href=""https://media.fb.com/2017/01/11/facebook-journalism-project/"">Facebook Journalism Project</a> to learn more about the unique experiences of the journalist community on Facebook. This culminated in the features we’re making available today, as well as <a href=""https://media.fb.com/2017/06/23/introducing-facebook-safety-for-journalists-resources/"">resources</a> for journalists to help them protect their themselves on Facebook.</p>

<p><em>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/joaquin.quinonero.candela"">Joaquin Quiñonero Candela</a>, Director, Applied Machine Learning</em></p>
<p>Today we’re announcing new, optional tools to help people better manage their identity on Facebook using face recognition. Powered by the same <a href=""https://vimeo.com/136019107"">technology</a> we’ve used to suggest friends you may want to tag in photos or videos, these new features help you find photos that you’re not tagged in and help you detect when others might be attempting to use your image as their profile picture. We’re also introducing a way for people who are visually impaired to know more about who is in the photos they encounter on Facebook.</p>
<p>People gave us feedback that they would find it easier to manage face recognition through a simple setting, so we’re pairing these tools with a single “on/off” control. If your tag suggestions setting is currently set to “none,” then your default face recognition setting will be set to “off” and will remain that way until you decide to change it.</p>
<p><b>Know When You Appear in Photos on Facebook </b></p>
<p>Now, if you’re in a photo and are part of the audience for that post, we’ll notify you, even if you haven’t been tagged. You’re in control of your image on Facebook and can make choices such as whether to tag yourself, leave yourself untagged, or reach out to the person who posted the photo if you have concerns about it. We always respect the privacy setting people select when posting a photo on Facebook (whether that’s friends, public or a custom audience), so you won’t receive a notification if you’re not in the audience.</p>

<p><b>Profile Photo Safety </b></p>
<p>We want people to feel confident when they post pictures of themselves on Facebook so we’ll soon begin using face recognition technology to let people know when someone else uploads a photo of them as their profile picture. We’re doing this to prevent people from impersonating others on Facebook.</p>
<p><b>New Tools for People with Visual Impairments</b></p>
<p>We’re always working to make it easier for all people, regardless of ability, to access Facebook, make connections and have more opportunities. Two years ago, we launched an <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10102456212502251/"">automatic alt-text tool</a>, which describes photos to people with vision loss. Now, with face recognition, people who use screen readers will know who appears in photos in their News Feed even if people aren’t tagged.</p>

<p><b>How it Works and the Choices You Have</b></p>
<p>Since 2010, face recognition technology has helped bring people closer together on Facebook. Our technology analyzes the pixels in photos you’re already tagged in and generates a string of numbers we call a template. When photos and videos are uploaded to our systems, we compare those images to the template.</p>
<p>You control whether Facebook can recognize you in photos and videos. Soon, you will begin to see a simple on/off switch instead of settings for individual features that use face recognition technology. We designed this as an on/off switch because people gave us feedback that they prefer a simpler control than having to decide for every single feature using face recognition technology.

<p><i>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/rmsherman"">Rob Sherman</a>, Deputy Chief Privacy Officer</i></p>
<p>The words “face recognition” can make some people feel uneasy, conjuring dystopian scenes from science fiction. Can someone use it to identify strangers on the street? Are institutions gathering mass databases of images that can be used to invade someone’s privacy or rights?</p>
<p>As government and non-government agencies, companies and others use face recognition technology in new ways, people want to understand how their privacy is being protected and what choices they have over how this technology is used.</p>
<p>Like many tools, face recognition can be used for good purposes — like helping people securely unlock their mobile devices, log into their bank accounts and make digital payments. It can help people organize their photos and share them with friends. It’s even being used to find missing and kidnapped children and to help officials confirm whether travelers have authentic passports.</p>
<p>But it can also be used in concerning ways. Some have <a href=""https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.franken.senate.gov%2F%3Fp%3Dpress_release%26id%3D3759&amp;h=ATMg7063FJADDeEXsQ94-iIeD73AaR9ze4PQLqka8rRYB9HMbVsB8Ei75dDta-DrRjdrSf5AUFLlNLmccGuPU3t_fdpl02DvfCi9aV-8ZdK-SQGGkMzy1yL1GaKjd6Z3vRbhvPYU0KD30iOYL-ss6M_T0XfQpQq-"">raised concerns</a> about how law enforcement uses the technology. Others have <a href=""https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2016%2F04%2Fthe-underlying-bias-of-facial-recognition-systems%2F476991%2F&amp;h=ATOC7GftqujonBadZmhXhgO9AYmb0-LNh7r4RLg5yhQAIyYCfjppYVd3X7-neA-QDyih5WRn9HbT6vY7pGpfOkLr8QwlJ7Fv7OG6h7kXMZS_dfyp9CS2ZX0-ZkKynxF7oSVITTcIoowiL-s2AnwCWLowiNNXUEIi"">called attention to</a> the potential for racial bias, arguing that facial recognition systems are more likely either to misidentify or fail to identify African Americans than people of other races. And while there have been proposals to regulate face recognition, there’s no consensus on whether or how to do so, and some approaches have been criticized for failing to focus on the most harmful potential uses.</p>
<p>This tension isn’t new. Society often welcomes the benefit of a new innovation while struggling to harness its potential. “Beware the Kodak,” one newspaper intoned in 1888 as inexpensive equipment came onto the market making photography available to the masses. They called it a “new terror for the picnic.” Confronting amateur photography for the first time, society could have restricted this technology – and fundamentally changed the way history was documented for more than a century. Instead, regulators took action on uses that raised concerns — for example, by prohibiting stalking or letting people sue for invasion of privacy — rather than requiring licenses to use “camera technology” or written consent forms before a person could appear in a photo. As a result, people became familiar with these early cameras, social norms evolved, and the world decided that the benefits of personal photography far outweighed the risks.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Face Recognition and Facebook</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook, face recognition helps people tag photos with the names of their friends. When you have face recognition enabled, our technology analyzes the pixels in photos you’re already tagged in and generates a string of numbers we call a template. When photos and videos are uploaded to our systems, we compare those images to the template. Here’s a video explaining how it works:</p>
<div class=""fb-video"" data-allowfullscreen=""true"" data-href=""https://www.facebook.com/facebook/videos/10156872585996729/""></div>
<p>When we first introduced this feature <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/making-photo-tagging-easier/467145887130/"">in 2010</a>, there was no industry standard for how people should be able to control face recognition.We decided to notify people on Facebook and provide a way to disable it in their account <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=timeline%C2%A7ion=suggestions&amp;view"">settings</a> at any time.</p>
<p>We recently announced new features that use face recognition technology. People can now find photos of themselves even when they aren’t tagged in them, making it possible for people to manage their privacy in new ways. They may also know when someone is using their image as a profile photo — which can help stop impersonation. In addition, those with vision impairments can now hear aloud who’s in the photos they come across on Facebook. Just as in 2010, we had to evaluate how we’d inform people and give them choice over these new uses of the technology.</p>
<p><strong>Our Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to face recognition, control matters. We listen carefully to feedback from people who use Facebook, as well as from experts in the field. We believe we have a responsibility to build these features in ways that deliver on the technology’s promise, while avoiding harmful ways that some might use it.</p>
<p>Our team has been working for more than a year to collect and respond to feedback on how people want to see us use this technology — and how we can do it most responsibly. People asked us to explain how face recognition works more clearly, and to provide more prominent information about how we might use it on Facebook. To address this feedback, we’re informing people about updates to face recognition in News Feed – the doorstep of Facebook.</p>
<p>We also decided to update Facebook’s settings. Concerns about updated settings are as old as Facebook, so we didn’t take the decision lightly. But we learned in our research that people want a way to completely turn off face recognition technology rather than on a feature-by-feature basis. We knew that as we introduced more features using this technology, most people would find it easier to manage one master setting rather than navigate a long list of products deciding what they want and what they don’t. Our new setting is an on/off switch. Some may criticize this as an “all or nothing” approach, but we believe this will prevent people from having to make additional decisions among potentially confusing options.</p>
<p>Finally, we aren’t introducing, and have no plans to introduce, features that tell strangers who you are. This was a common concern we heard from people when we researched new features that rely on face recognition technology.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p>
<p>As people use features on Facebook that use face recognition technology, we’ll learn more about what our community thinks of them — good, bad or in between. And we’ll learn what they think of our updated controls. We’ll build on these lessons and keep people informed about the work we’re doing to innovate and responsibly use this technology on Facebook.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s too early to know if face recognition will follow the path of the personal camera. But we look forward to the public’s feedback and to working with other companies and organizations as we continue to listen and learn.</p>

<p><i>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/chris.sonderby"">Chris Sonderby</a>, Deputy General Counsel</i></p>
<p>Today we are releasing our <a href=""https://transparency.facebook.com/"">Transparency Report</a>, previously called the Government Requests Report, for the first half of 2017. For the first time, we are expanding the report beyond government requests to provide data regarding reports from rights holders related to intellectual property (IP) — covering copyright, trademark, and counterfeit. The report also includes the same categories of information we’ve disclosed in the past, with updates on government requests for account data, content restrictions, and internet disruptions.</p>
<p>We believe that sharing information about IP reports we receive from rights holders is an important step toward being more open and clear about how we protect the people and businesses that use our services. Our Transparency Report describes these policies and procedures in more detail, along with the steps we’ve taken to safeguard the people who use Facebook and keep them informed about IP. It also includes data covering the volume and nature of copyright, trademark, and counterfeit reports we’ve received and the amount of content affected by those reports. For example, in the first half of 2017, we received 224,464 copyright reports about content on Facebook, 41,854 trademark reports, and 14,279 counterfeit reports.</p>
<p>In addition to our new section on intellectual property, we are also providing our usual twice-a-year update on government requests for account data, content restrictions based on local law, and information about internet disruptions in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Requests for account data increased by 21% globally compared to the second half of 2016, from 64,279 to 78,890. Fifty-seven percent of the data requests we received from law enforcement in the U.S. contained a non-disclosure order that prohibited us from notifying the user, up from 50% in our last report. Additionally, as a result of transparency reforms introduced in 2016 by the USA Freedom Act, the U.S. government notified us that it was lifting the non-disclosure order on five National Security Letters (NSLs) we previously received between 2012 and 2015. Copies of the NSLs, as well as the government’s authorization letters are available for download below.</p>
<p>We continue to carefully scrutinize each request we receive for account data — whether from an authority in the U.S., Europe, or elsewhere — to make sure it is legally sufficient. If a request appears to be deficient or overly broad, we push back, and will fight in court, if necessary. We’ll also keep working with partners in industry and civil society to encourage governments around the world to reform surveillance in a way that protects their citizens’ safety and security while respecting their rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>Overall, the number of content restrictions for violating local law increased by 304% globally, compared to the second half of 2016, from 6,944 to 28,036. This increase was primarily driven by a request from Mexican law enforcement to remove instances of a video depicting a school shooting in Monterrey in January. We restricted access in Mexico to 20,506 instances of the video in the first half of 2017.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there were 52 disruptions of Facebook services in nine countries in the first half of 2017, compared to 43 disruptions in 20 countries in the second half of 2016. We continue to be deeply concerned by internet disruptions, which can create barriers for businesses and prevent people from sharing and communicating with their family and friends.</p>
<p>Publishing this report reinforces our important commitment to transparency as we build community and bring the world closer together.</p>

<p>People have told us that they dislike spammy posts on Facebook that goad them into interacting with likes, shares, comments, and other actions. For example, “LIKE this if you’re an Aries!” This tactic, known as “engagement bait,” seeks to take advantage of our News Feed algorithm by boosting engagement in order to get greater reach. So, starting this week, we will begin demoting individual posts from people and Pages that use engagement bait.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-9444"" data-attachment-id=""9444"" data-comments-opened=""0"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""0"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":"""",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""0"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""0"",""iso"":""0"",""shutter_speed"":""0"",""title"":"""",""orientation"":""0""}' data-image-title=""Combo1"" data-large-file=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=960&amp;h=683"" data-medium-file=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png"" data-orig-size=""1972,1402"" data-permalink=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/news-feed-fyi-fighting-engagement-bait-on-facebook/combo1/"" height=""683"" sizes=""(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=960&amp;h=683"" srcset=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=960&amp;h=683 960w, https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=1920&amp;h=1366 1920w, https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=563&amp;h=400 563w, https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=300&amp;h=213 300w, https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=768&amp;h=546 768w, https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=1024&amp;h=728 1024w"" width=""960""/></p>
<p>To help us foster more authentic engagement, teams at Facebook have reviewed and categorized hundreds of thousands of posts to inform a machine learning model that can detect different types of engagement bait. Posts that use this tactic will be shown less in News Feed.</p>
<p>Additionally, over the coming weeks, we will begin implementing stricter demotions for Pages that systematically and repeatedly use engagement bait to artificially gain reach in News Feed. We will roll out this Page-level demotion over the course of several weeks to give publishers time to adapt and avoid inadvertently using engagement bait in their posts. Moving forward, we will continue to find ways to improve and scale our efforts to reduce engagement bait.</p>
<p>Posts that ask people for help, advice, or recommendations, such as circulating a missing child report, raising money for a cause, or asking for travel tips, will not be adversely impacted by this update.</p>
<p>Instead, we will demote posts that go against one of our key News Feed values — <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/06/building-a-better-news-feed-for-you/"">authenticity</a>. Similar to our other recent efforts to demote <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/05/news-feed-fyi-new-updates-to-reduce-clickbait-headlines/"">clickbait headlines</a> and links to <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/05/reducing-links-to-low-quality-web-page-experiences/"">low-quality web page experiences</a>, we want to reduce the spread of content that is spammy, sensational, or misleading in order to promote more meaningful and authentic conversations on Facebook.</p>

<p><b>How will this impact Pages?</b><br/>
Publishers and other businesses that use engagement bait tactics in their posts should expect their reach on these posts to decrease. Meanwhile, Pages that repeatedly share engagement bait posts will see more significant drops in reach. Page Admins should continue to focus on posting relevant and meaningful stories that do not use engagement bait tactics.

<p><strong><i>Update 4/4:</i></strong> In December, we announced that we would begin demoting individual posts in English from people and Pages that use engagement bait. We recently expanded this to Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian, and German posts as well, and today are also extending this to posts in Portuguese.</p>
<p><strong>Update 4/26: </strong>Starting today, we have expanded this to posts in Mandarin, Hindi, Indonesian, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Thai, and Turkish.</p>
<p><strong>Update 6/25:</strong> Starting today, we have expanded this to posts in Bengali, Bulgarian, Dutch, Greek, Hungarian, Korean, Malay, Polish, and Romanian.</p>
<p><strong>Update 11/13:</strong> Starting today, we will be demoting comments which contain engagement bait.</p>
<p><strong>Update 1/30/19:</strong> Starting today, we will be demoting videos which contain engagement bait in the audio.</p>

19,"December 15, 2017","<div class=""post-content"">
<p><i>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ginsberg1"">David Ginsberg</a>, Director of Research, and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mburke"">Moira Burke</a>, Research Scientist at Facebook</i></p>
<p>With people spending more time on social media, many rightly wonder whether that time is good for us. Do people connect in meaningful ways online? Or are they simply consuming trivial updates and polarizing memes at the expense of time with loved ones?</p>
<p>These are critical questions for Silicon Valley — and for both of us. Moira is a social psychologist who has studied the impact of the internet on people’s lives for more than a decade, and I lead the research team for the Facebook app. As parents, each of us worries about our kids’ screen time and what “connection” will mean in 15 years. We also worry about spending too much time on our phones when we should be paying attention to our families. One of the ways we combat our inner struggles is with research — reviewing what others have found, conducting our own, and asking questions when we need to learn more.</p>
<p>A lot of smart people are looking at different aspects of this important issue. Psychologist Sherry Turkle <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/sherry_turkle_alone_together"">asserts</a> that mobile phones redefine modern relationships, making us “alone together.” In her generational analyses of teens, psychologist Jean Twenge <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/"">notes</a> an increase in teen depression corresponding with technology use. Both offer compelling research.</p>
<p>But it’s not the whole story. Sociologist Claude Fischer <a href=""http://bostonreview.net/blog/claude-fischer-sherry-turkle-smart-phone-social-communication"">argues</a> that claims that technology drives us apart are largely supported by anecdotes and ignore the benefits. Sociologist Keith Hampton’s study of public spaces <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/magazine/technology-is-not-driving-us-apart-after-all.html"">suggests</a> that people spend more time in public now — and that cell phones in public are more often used by people passing time on their own, rather than ignoring friends in person.</p>
<p>We want Facebook to be a place for meaningful interactions with your friends and family — enhancing your relationships offline, not detracting from them. After all, that’s what Facebook has always been about. This is important as we know that a person’s health and happiness <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316"">relies heavily</a> on the strength of their relationships.</p>
<p>In this post, we want to give you some insights into how the research team at Facebook works with our product teams to incorporate well-being principles, and review some of the top scientific research on well-being and social media that informs our work. Of course, this isn’t just a Facebook issue — it’s an internet issue — so we collaborate with leading experts and publish in the top peer-reviewed journals. We work with scientists like Robert Kraut at Carnegie Mellon; Sonja Lyubomirsky at UC Riverside; Dacher Keltner, Emiliana Simon-Thomas, and Matt Killingsworth from the <a href=""https://ggsc.berkeley.edu/"">Greater Good Science Center</a> at UC Berkeley, and have partnered closely with mental health clinicians and organizations like <a href=""http://save.org/"">Save.org</a> and the <a href=""https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/"">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a>.</p>
<p><b>What Do Academics Say? Is Social Media Good or Bad for Well-Being?</b></p>
<p>According to the research, it really comes down to <i>how</i> you use the technology. For example, on social media, you can passively scroll through posts, much like watching TV, or actively interact with friends — messaging and commenting on each other’s posts. Just like in person, interacting with people you care about can be beneficial, while simply watching others from the sidelines may make you feel worse.</p>
<p><b>The bad: </b>In general, when people spend a lot of time <b>passively consuming</b> information — reading but not interacting with people — they report feeling worse afterward. In one experiment, University of Michigan students randomly assigned to read Facebook for 10 minutes were in a <a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-08049-001"">worse mood</a> at the end of the day than students assigned to post or talk to friends on Facebook. A study from UC San Diego and Yale found that people who clicked on about four times as many links as the average person, or who liked twice as many posts, reported <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/185/3/203/2915143"">worse mental health</a> than average in a survey. Though the causes aren’t clear, researchers hypothesize that reading about others online might lead to <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sipr.12033/full"">negative social comparison</a> — and perhaps even more so than offline, since people’s posts are often more curated and flattering. Another theory is that the internet takes people away from social engagement in person.</p>
<p><b>The good:</b> On the other hand, <b>actively interacting with people </b>— especially sharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions — is linked to improvements in well-being. This ability to connect with relatives, classmates, and colleagues is what drew many of us to Facebook in the first place, and it’s no surprise that staying in touch with these friends and loved ones brings us joy and strengthens our sense of community.</p>
<p>A study we conducted with Robert Kraut at Carnegie Mellon University found that people who sent or received more messages, comments and Timeline posts reported <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcc4.12162/full"">improvements in social support, depression and loneliness</a>. The positive effects were even stronger when people <a href=""http://repository.cmu.edu/dissertations/185/"">talked with their close friends</a> online. Simply <b>broadcasting status updates wasn’t enough</b>; people had to interact one-on-one with others in their network. Other peer-reviewed <a href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093650215617506"">longitudinal research</a> and <a href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550612469233"">experiments</a> have found similar positive benefits between well-being and <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15534510.2014.893924"">active engagement</a> on Facebook.</p>
<p>In an experiment at Cornell, stressed college students randomly assigned to scroll through their own Facebook profiles for five minutes experienced <a href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167212474694"">boosts in self-affirmation</a> compared to students who looked at a stranger’s Facebook profile. The researchers believe self-affirmation comes from reminiscing on past meaningful interactions — seeing photos they had been tagged in and comments their friends had left — as well as reflecting on one’s own past posts, where a person chooses how to present themselves to the world.</p>
<p>In a follow-up study, the Cornell researchers put other students under stress by giving them negative feedback on a test and then gave them a choice of websites to visit afterward, including Facebook, YouTube, online music and online video games. They found that stressed students were <a href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167212474694"">twice as likely</a> to choose Facebook to make themselves feel better as compared with students who hadn’t been put under stress.</p>
<p>In sum, our research and <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sipr.12033/full"">other academic literature</a> suggests that it’s about <i>how</i> you use social media that matters when it comes to your well-being.</p>

<p><b>So what are we doing about it?</b></p>
<p>We’re working to make Facebook more about social interaction and less about spending time. As our CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104146268321841"">said</a>, “We want the time people spend on Facebook to encourage meaningful social interactions.” Facebook has always been about bringing people together — from the early days when we started reminding people about their friends’ birthdays, to showing people their memories with friends using the feature we call “On This Day.” We’re also a place for people to come together in times of need, from fundraisers for disaster relief to groups where people can find an organ donor. We’re always working to expand these communities and find new ways to have a positive impact on people’s lives.</p>
<p>We employ social psychologists, social scientists and sociologists, and we collaborate with top scholars to better understand well-being and work to make Facebook a place that contributes in a positive way. Here are a few things we’ve worked on recently to help support people’s well-being.</p>
<p><b>News Feed quality</b>: We’ve made several changes to News Feed to provide more opportunities for meaningful interactions and reduce passive consumption of low-quality content — even if it decreases some of our engagement metrics in the short term. We demote things like <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/05/news-feed-fyi-new-updates-to-reduce-clickbait-headlines/"">clickbait headlines</a> and <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/12/news-feed-fyi-addressing-hoaxes-and-fake-news/"">false news</a>, even though people often click on those links at a high rate. We optimize ranking so <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/06/news-feed-fyi-helping-make-sure-you-dont-miss-stories-from-friends/"">posts from the friends you care about most</a> are more likely to appear at the top of your feed because that’s what people tell us in surveys that they want to see. Similarly, our ranking promotes posts that are<a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/08/news-feed-fyi-showing-you-more-personally-informative-stories/""> personally informative</a>. We also recently <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/08/making-news-feed-an-easier-place-to-connect-and-navigate/"">redesigned the comments feature</a> to foster better conversations.</p>
<p><b>Snooze:</b> People often tell us they want more say over what they see in News Feed. Today, we <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/news-feed-fyi-snooze/"">launched</a> Snooze, which gives people the option to hide a person, Page or group for 30 days, without having to permanently unfollow or unfriend them. This will give people more control over their feed and hopefully make their experience more positive.</p>
<p><b>Take a Break: </b>Millions of people break up on Facebook each week, changing their relationship status from “in a relationship” to “single.” Research on peoples’ experiences after breakups suggests that offline and online contact, including <a href=""http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2012.0125"">seeing an ex-partner’s activities</a>, can make emotional recovery more difficult. To help make this experience easier, we built a tool called <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/kelly-grimaldi/designing-a-product-to-ease-one-of-lifes-difficult-moments/10153139353216581/"">Take a Break</a>, which gives people more centralized control over when they see their ex on Facebook, what their ex can see, and who can see their past posts.</p>
<p><b>Suicide prevention tools:</b> Research shows that <a href=""http://www.jad-journal.com/article/S0165-0327(13)00088-8/fulltext"">social support can help prevent suicide</a>. Facebook is in a unique position to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/fbsafety/videos/1098099763561194/"">connect people in distress</a> with resources that can help. We work with people and organizations around the world to develop <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/fbsafety/photos/a.197686146935898.42079.125459124158601/1041262189244952/"">support options</a> for people posting about suicide on Facebook, including reaching out to a friend, contacting help lines and reading tips about things they can do in that moment. We recently released <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/03/building-a-safer-community-with-new-suicide-prevention-tools/"">suicide prevention support on Facebook Live</a> and introduced<a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/11/getting-our-community-help-in-real-time/""> artificial intelligence to detect suicidal posts </a>even before they are reported. We also connect people more broadly with <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/05/connecting-people-with-mental-health-resources-and-building-a-safer-community/"">mental health resources</a>, including support groups on Facebook.</p>
<div class=""fb-video"" data-allowfullscreen=""true"" data-href=""https://facebook.com/facebook/videos/10156872543026729/""></div>
<p><b>What About Related Areas Like Digital Distraction and the Impact of Technology on Kids?</b></p>
<p>We know that people are concerned about how technology affects our attention spans and relationships, as well as how it affects children in the long run. We agree these are critically important questions, and we all have a lot more to learn.</p>
<p>That’s why we <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/hard-questions-kids-online/"">recently pledged</a> $1 million toward research to better understand the relationship between media technologies, youth development and well-being. We’re teaming up with experts in the field to look at the impact of mobile technology and social media on kids and teens, as well as how to better support them as they transition through different stages of life.</p>
<p>We’re also making investments to better understand digital distraction and the factors that can pull people away from important face-to-face interactions. Is multitasking hurting our personal relationships? How about our ability to focus? Next year we’ll host a summit with academics and other industry leaders to tackle these issues together.</p>
<p>We don’t have all the answers, but given the prominent role social media now plays in many people’s lives, we want to help elevate the conversation. In the years ahead we’ll be doing more to dig into these questions, share our findings and improve our products. At the end of the day, we’re committed to bringing people together and supporting well-being through meaningful interactions on Facebook.</p>

<p class=""p1""><em>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/chris.sonderby"">Chris Sonderby</a>, Deputy General Counsel</em></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Today we are releasing our latest Global Government Requests Report for the first half of 2016, which details the number of government requests we received for data, as well as the number of items restricted for violating local law in countries where our service is available.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Government requests for account data increased by 27% globally compared to the last half of 2015, increasing from 46,710 to 59,229 requests. The majority of data requests we received from law enforcement in the United States, or approximately 56%, contained a non-disclosure order that prohibited us from notifying the user. As for content restriction requests, the number of items restricted for violating local law decreased by 83% from 55,827 to 9,663. Last cycle’s figures had been elevated primarily by French content restrictions of a single image from the November 13, 2015 terrorist attacks.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">For the first time, our report includes information about the requests we receive from governments around the world to preserve data pending receipt of formal legal process. As we describe in our law enforcement guidelines, when we receive a preservation request, we will preserve a temporary snapshot of the relevant account information. We do not disclose any of the preserved records unless and until we receive formal and valid legal process. During this reporting period, we received 38,675 preservation requests for 67,129 accounts.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">In addition, we have expanded our reporting of emergency requests and disclosures to include countries outside the United States. In cases of emergency, Facebook may disclose information where we believe that the matter involves imminent risk of serious injury or death. In all of these cases, we require law enforcement to describe the emergency and explain how the requested disclosure might prevent harm. In this reporting period, we received 3,016 emergency requests for 4,192 accounts.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s2"">Finally, as a result of transparency reforms introduced this year by the USA Freedom Act, our report also contains additional information concerning National Security Letters (NSLs). Under a process mandated by the Act for lifting nondisclosure obligations, the government lifted a gag requirement on one NSL issued in the second half of 2015. Accordingly, we have updated the range of NSLs in that half from 0-499 to 1-499. The NSL itself, as well as the government’s authorization letter, are available </span><span class=""s3""><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/u4u5ualbac350m6/Redacted_NSL_Letters.pdf?dl=0"">here</a>.</span></p>
<p class=""p4""><span class=""s2"">As we have previously emphasized, we apply a rigorous approach to every government request we receive to protect the information of the people who use our services. We scrutinize each request for legal sufficiency, no matter which country is making the request, and challenge those that are deficient or overly broad. We do not provide governments with “back doors” or direct access to people’s information. We’ll also keep working with partners in industry and civil society to push governments around the world to reform surveillance in a way that protects their citizens’ safety and security while respecting their rights and freedoms.</span></p>

<p>Every day people use Facebook to share moments with their friends. Today we’re introducing a marketing program to invite people to share and talk about events and moments that are happening in their communities and around the world.</p>
<p>Messages from Facebook will appear at the top of News Feed about a specific event or moment. Our goal is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give people ways to connect and share with friends during holidays and events</li>
<li>Help people discover fun and interesting cultural moments</li>
<li>Celebrate moments in history that continue to make the world more open and connected</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some recent examples of moments that we’ve shared with people in the US:</p>

<p><b>Share a Holiday Card</b></p>
<p>Starting today, people will see a message from Facebook in their News Feed wishing them Happy Holidays. People will be invited to share a holiday card with their friends on Facebook and choose from a set of 18 custom-designed cards.</p>

22,"December 19, 2016","<div class=""post-content"">
<p><em>By: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/stephane.taine"">Stephane Taine</a>, Product Manager, Messenger</em></p>
<p>As we close the year, we’re thrilled to launch the most requested Messenger feature ever — the ability to video chat in groups. Group Video Chat in Messenger makes it simple and seamless to stay connected face-to-face. Starting today, Group Video Chat is rolling out to Android and iOS devices, and the desktop version of Messenger, worldwide.</p>
<p>More and more people use messaging in groups for lots of different reasons like keeping everyone up to date, planning a family vacation or to share a few jokes. With 245 million people making video calls in Messenger every month, now we’re bringing everyone on Messenger the ability to turn group chats into face-to-face conversations no matter where you are – whether you’re down the street or halfway across the world. Chatting face-to-face live as a group is perfect for those spontaneous moments when text just isn’t enough… or when you have a major case of FOMO. It’s the best way to share the news you just got a job (or into college), have your kids wish grandma a happy birthday, tell a funny story to the people you love or just see your friends live while wearing fun 3D masks (iOS only for now — Android coming soon) to an everyday conversation.</p>
<p><b>Here’s How It Works</b></p>
<p>Group Video Chat is super easy to use (and, of course, free over Wi-Fi). You can see up to six people at a time … but don’t worry if your group is a little larger because up to 50 friends can join in and choose to just listen in and join via voice, or be on camera. Once more than six people are on the call, just the dominant speaker is shown to all participants.</p>
<p>To get started, you’ll need the latest version of Messenger. All you have to do is jump into an existing group conversation, or create a new one. Then tap on the video icon on the upper right of the screen to enter the video chat and everyone in the group will be notified. Each person can join when they are ready with just one tap. For an extra nudge, you can also directly ring just a few people or the whole group.</p>

<p>This is the time of year to tell our friends and family how much we care about them and send best wishes for the year ahead. We’re delighted to bring you the ability to chat face-to-face with those who matter to you most, wherever they are. We look forward to hearing what you think.</p>

<p><em>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/adam"">Adam Mosseri</a>, VP, News Feed</em></p>
<p>A few weeks ago we <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10103269806149061"">previewed some of the things</a> we’re working on to address the issue of fake news and hoaxes. We’re committed to doing our part and today we’d like to share some updates we’re testing and starting to roll out.</p>
<p>We believe in giving people a voice and that we cannot become arbiters of truth ourselves, so we’re approaching this problem carefully. We’ve focused our efforts on the worst of the worst, on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain, and on engaging both our community and third party organizations.</p>
<p>The work falls into the following four areas. These are just some of the first steps we’re taking to improve the experience for people on Facebook. We’ll learn from these tests, and iterate and extend them over time.</p>
<p><b>Easier Reporting</b><br/>
We’re testing several ways to make it easier to report a hoax if you see one on Facebook, which you can do by clicking the upper right hand corner of a post. We’ve relied heavily on our community for help on this issue, and this can help us detect more fake news.</p>

<p><b>Flagging Stories as Disputed</b><br/>
We believe providing more context can help people decide for themselves what to trust and what to share. We’ve started a program to work with third-party fact checking organizations that are signatories of <a href=""http://www.poynter.org/fact-checkers-code-of-principles/""><u>Poynter’s International Fact Checking Code of Principles</u></a>. We’ll use the reports from our community, along with other signals, to send stories to these organizations. If the fact checking organizations identify a story as fake, it will get flagged as disputed and there will be a link to the corresponding article explaining why. Stories that have been disputed may also appear lower in News Feed.</p>

<p>Once a story is flagged, it can’t be made into an ad and promoted, either.</p>
<p><b>Informed Sharing</b><br/>
We’re always looking to improve News Feed by listening to what the community is telling us. We’ve found that if reading an article makes people significantly less likely to share it, that may be a sign that a story has misled people in some way. We’re going to test incorporating this signal into ranking, specifically for articles that are outliers, where people who read the article are significantly less likely to share it.</p>
<p><b>Disrupting Financial Incentives for Spammers</b><br/>
We’ve found that a lot of fake news is financially motivated. Spammers make money by masquerading as well-known news organizations, and posting hoaxes that get people to visit to their sites, which are often mostly ads. So we’re doing several things to reduce the financial incentives. On the buying side we’ve eliminated the ability to spoof domains, which will reduce the prevalence of sites that pretend to be real publications. On the publisher side, we are analyzing publisher sites to detect where policy enforcement actions might be necessary.</p>
<p>It’s important to us that the stories you see on Facebook are authentic and meaningful. We’re excited about this progress, but we know there’s more to be done. We’re going to keep working on this problem for as long as it takes to get it right.</p>

<p><strong>Fast Camera, Unique Art and 3D Special Effects</strong></p>
<p><em>By Peter Martinazzi, Product Manager, Messenger</em></p>
<p>Today we are excited to launch a brand new, faster and easier-to-use camera with art and special effects to help make your conversations better than ever. Rolling out globally over the coming days, we hope you’ll be as happy as we are with the new experience in your favorite messaging app. We’ve seen that the way people are messaging is becoming much more visual. In fact, over 2.5 billion emojis, photos, stickers and videos are sent every day on Messenger.</p>
<p>In some ways the camera is now replacing the keyboard. As more people use Messenger in their everyday lives, we wanted to make it faster, simpler and more fun to send photos and videos — so we built the new Messenger camera.</p>
<p><strong>What’s New?</strong></p>
<p>It’s even quicker and easier to capture and share moments as they happen. Imagine the Messenger camera as a powerful new tool that lives just behind your inbox. It’s always one tap away — whether you’re already in a conversation or have just opened up the app. You will see the shutter button center in the screen (we’ve dressed it up for the holidays!) a tap takes photo, a long press records a video.</p>

<p>We’re also introducing a place to find new art and special effects. We are especially excited to debut 3D masks and special effects, which make it super easy to apply an artistic filter to your full screen photo and to turn your world into a work of art. Try them out — you can take a selfie and transform into a reindeer or play with falling snow or even just ask someone how they are doing — it’s the perfect way to spread a little happiness in your messages.</p>

<p>We’ve also added thousands of stickers, frames, masks and effects to choose from too — and you can personalize exactly how you use it. We’ve worked with artists and influencers all over the world and these artists have added their own touch to the customization tools you can now use in Messenger.</p>

<p>And there’s more! Unique to Messenger we’ve also created a place where you can make your text messages even more fun. Check out the palette icon by the shutter and it will take you to a blank canvas where you can add art and stickers to your text. We’re making it super easy to add more delight to the conversations you’re having about what you’re doing, how you’re feeling and the plans you are making.</p>
<p>Of course, if you just want to send a message with only text, you can still do that too. All of the features that you know and love in Messenger are just the same. We can’t wait to hear your thoughts about our new Messenger camera!</p>

<p><b>Ads Creation: Improvement to Estimated Reach Methodology</b></p>
<p>To help advertisers get a better view of the number of people they can expect to reach with ads, this week we are updating how we calculate the numbers that appear in our estimated reach tool — found when <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ads/manager/creation/creation/?act=10150118785847113&amp;url=https://www.facebook.com/ads/create/&amp;campaign_id=163681540489385&amp;placement=/business/help/132037906870538&amp;creative=cta_button"">creating an ad</a>. When an advertiser begins creating a campaign, the tool provides them with an estimate of both the potential overall reach and the estimated daily reach of their ad campaign. Note that this tool does not reflect reach for campaigns that have already run, nor does it affect any other reach metrics.</p>
<p>We’re improving our methodology for sampling and extrapolating potential audience sizes. This will help to provide a more accurate estimate for a given target audience and to better account for audiences across multiple platforms (Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network). In most cases, advertisers should expect to see less than a 10% change (increase or decrease) in the audience sizes shown in the tool.<br/>

<p><b>Live Video Metrics in Page Insights: Reallocating Streaming Reactions Counts on Posts</b></p>
<p>For Live videos, we introduced streaming reactions. Live video posts can have multiple reactions per person, since people can react at any moment of the live broadcast.</p>
<p>In Page Insights in the column for “Reactions on Post,” however, we show only one reaction per unique user. We misallocated the extra reactions per user that happened during the live broadcast to the “Reactions from Shares of Post” section, instead of counting them in the “Reactions on Post” section, so we’re making a change to correct it. Note that total counts were and are correct; some of them were just captured in the wrong reporting column when broken out.</p>
<p>The fix for this issue will apply to newly created Live videos, starting mid-December. It will increase “Reactions on Post” by 500% on average and will decrease them on “Reactions from Shares of Post” by 25% on average (actual impact to specific videos may vary).<br/>

<p><b>Like, Share Buttons and Mobile Search Discrepancy</b></p>
<p>We have identified a discrepancy between the counts for the <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button"">Like</a> and <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/share-button"">Share</a> Buttons via our Graph API and the counts when you enter a URL into the search bar in the Facebook mobile app (see screenshot below).</p>
<p>To clarify, our Like and Share button metrics pull:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of likes of a URL off Facebook</li>
<li>The number of shares of a URL off Facebook (this includes copy/pasting a link back to Facebook)</li>
<li>The number of likes and comments on stories on Facebook about a URL</li>
</ul>
<p>We have found that there may be a difference between what these metrics count and what the mobile search query counts. We are looking into why inputting the URL as a search query in Facebook’s mobile app might have corresponding numbers that can be higher or lower in certain cases. We are working to resolve this issue so that the Like and Share button metrics and our mobile search query metrics match up, and we will notify partners as soon as we have an update.</p>

<p>In preparation for the coming weeks as many of us spend lots of time with friends and family, Messenger is rolling out some new features to make it easy for you to surprise and delight those you love.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing Photo Magic</strong></p>
<p>Today we are making Photo Magic, which has been in testing for the last month, available to more people. Feedback has been great, and we are looking forward to making it easier to share more photos, especially this time of year. Photo sharing in Messenger is growing at a fast rate. In fact, more than 9.5 billion photos are sent in Messenger each month alone. But there is still a lot of friction in sending the photos you take to your friends who are in them. Now in Messenger, after you take a picture of a friend or group of friends, if you want to, we’ll help you send it immediately. You won’t need to stop the fun to make sure everyone has a copy of the picture. Photo Magic will help you keep your promise to send the pictures you take without forgetting, or worse, leaving someone out. Also<b>,</b> we know there are times when you want to share photos privately, and Photo Magic makes it effortless to do so while still keeping you in complete control. So at a time of the year when more photos are taken than any other (last year Messenger saw hundreds of millions of photo sends on New Year’s Eve), we’re making it simple for you to share those happy moments.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s How It Works</strong></p>
<p>By recognizing your Facebook friends in the photos you take (just like when tagging or sharing photos on Facebook), Messenger can create a group thread for you to share the photos with those friends in just two taps. It’s fast, easy, and simple. And you can turn this feature on or off at anytime as well as control if you are recognized in your friends’ photos in the timeline and tagging section of your Facebook settings. Check it out here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure the feature is enabled (you can do this by going into your “Settings” menu in Messenger, but you’ll also be prompted to try Photo Magic – you can say “Try It” or choose to “X” it out)</li>
<li>Once you take a photo with your friends, you’ll get a reminder to send the photo to them (the photo will not be sent unless you tap Send)</li>
<li>If you choose not to share the photo, hit “Cancel”</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Messenger Just Got Way More Customized</b></p>
<p class=""p1"" style=""text-align:left;"">In addition to making it easier to send photos, we are rolling out new fun ways to customize your conversations with different people and groups. With various color choices, emoji and nicknames, now you can really make Messenger your own space. For iOS, tap on the people’s names at the top of a conversation to change your family group thread to a festive red, update your mom’s formal first and last name to just “Mom,” or change the emoji response in your holiday meet up group from the thumbs up to something more timely, like a party hat. For Android, tap the info button in the top right. Anyone in the conversation can change the colors, nicknames and emojis as many times as they want, and when you make a change, the people you’re talking to will see what updates you selected.</p>

<p><b>Let It Snow…</b></p>
<p class=""p1"" style=""text-align:left;"">We’re constantly thinking about ways to surprise and delight you and your friends. And now for the holidays, we’re bringing the prettiest snowflakes to your messages. Whether you are in Alaska or Australia, you can share some winter fun, even if your current weather status isn’t set to North Pole. Send a Santa, Christmas tree or snow-related sticker or emoji to a friend and watch the magic happen; it’s just like being inside your own snow globe.<br/>

<p>We’re also <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/12/happy-holidays-from-messenger/""><u>bringing back</u></a> the beloved snow globe effect for chat heads on Android. For a limited time this season, your friends’ chat heads will appear as winter wonderlands (if you’re north of the Equator, of course). Similarly, to celebrate the new year later on, your friends’ chat heads will become confetti-filled.</p>

<p>Messenger is your place to communicate seamlessly with everyone – from making plans with friends, sharing pictures and moments with your loved ones, sending money, and talking to your favorite businesses about a purchase or getting updates on your item’s delivery. Millions of people all over the world use Messenger every month to engage with businesses because it’s simple, secure, convenient and keeps everything in one place.</p>
<p>Technology can make all of our engagements with businesses better, and over the past year Messenger has added integrations with select retailers, household brands and hotels to make your most common and every day business interactions more productive.</p>
<p>Today, we’re expanding the services available to you with our launch of transportation on Messenger. With this new feature, you can request a ride from a car service without ever needing to download an extra app or leave a conversation. It’s super easy and doesn’t take you away from the plans that you’re making with your friends or family.</p>
<p>Whether you’re meeting friends for lunch, on your way to a concert, or running late for work, Messenger and our partners can get you to your destination faster.</p>
<p>To get started, download the latest version of Messenger. Then, from within a conversation, tap the more menu and choose Transportation. You can also search directly for Uber – our first partner – and tap the car icon to request a ride. From there, you’ll receive updates on your driver’s status and notify your friends that you’ve called a ride. With the ability to request, track and pay for a ride in Messenger, we’re making transportation as simple as sending a message.</p>

<p><b>Your first ride is free</b></p>
<p>For a limited time, you’ll get a free ride the first time you use this feature (up to $20 value) with Uber. All you have to do to claim your free ride is link your existing Uber account<strong>*</strong> or set up a new account within Messenger and request a ride. Driver status updates and payment receipts will get delivered to a private conversation between you and Uber. With everything in one place, you can seamlessly keep track of your ride and payment history.</p>
<p><b>The fine print</b></p>
<p>This service is currently in testing and will be available to select users in the locations where Uber operates in the United States. More countries and other transportation partners will be available soon.</p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><em><strong>*</strong>Update as of 1/4/16:</em> The free ride for existing Uber users is no longer in effect, but it’s still available for new Uber users. </span></p>

<p><i>Community Support FYI is a series of posts about how we work to keep the Facebook community safe, supported and connected.</i></p>
<p><i>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/josofsky?fref=ts"">Justin Osofsky</a>, Vice President of Global Operations, and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/toddgage1?fref=ts"">Todd Gage</a>, Product Manager</i></p>
<p>Facebook is a place where people share and connect with their family and friends. In order for this to happen, people need to feel safe and be confident they know who they are communicating with.</p>
<p>On Facebook, we require people to use the name their friends and family know them by. When people use the names they are known by, their actions and words carry more weight because they are more accountable for what they say. It also makes it harder for bullies to anonymously smear the reputations of others, or anyone else to use an anonymous name to harass, scam or engage in criminal behavior.</p>
<p>We’re firmly committed to this policy, and it is not changing. However, after hearing feedback from our community, we recognize that it’s also important that this policy works for everyone, especially for communities who are marginalized or face discrimination. That’s why we’re continuing to make improvements in this area.</p>
<p>Today, we will begin to test new tools that address two key goals. First, we want to reduce the number of people who are asked to verify their name on Facebook when they are already using the name people know them by. Second, we want to make it easier for people to confirm their name if necessary. These tools have been built based on many conversations with community leaders and safety organizations around the world.</p>
<p><b>A new version of names reporting that requires people to provide context</b><br/>
We are introducing a new version of the names reporting process that requires people to provide additional information about why they are reporting a name. In the past, people were able to simply report a “fake name” but now they will be required to go through several new steps that provide us more specifics about the report. This additional context will help our review teams better understand why someone is reporting a name, giving them more information about a specific situation.</p>

<p><b>A new way for people to describe their special circumstance when verifying their name</b><br/>
We’re also testing a new tool that will let people provide more information about their circumstances if they are asked to verify their name. People can let us know they have a special circumstance, and then give us more information about their unique situation.

<p>In addition to these two improvements, over the last year, we made several other changes to our processes to make sure they work for everyone. We expanded the options and documents that everyone on Facebook can use to verify their name. We started rolling out a new process in which people will have access to their account for seven days while they verify or update their name. We also implemented additional security protections for documents that people share with us when they are verifying their name.</p>
<p>These improvements are only the beginning. Early in the new year, we will be looking at other ways we can reduce the number of people who have to go through an ID verification experience, while preserving the safety of other people on the site. We will also continue to work on making the experience itself more compassionate and easier to navigate. Throughout this process, we will continue our ongoing conversations with the Facebook community so they can share their thoughts on improvements they’d like to see.</p>
<p>These tools are currently being tested on a limited basis in the US only, across mobile and desktop. Based on feedback, we will iterate and roll them out globally.</p>
<p>We want to create the best experience that we can for everyone, and we will continue to make improvements until everyone can use the name that their friends and family know them by.</p>

<p>Our mission with News Feed is to connect people with the stories that matter most to them, but if people’s News Feeds aren’t loading because of poor internet connection, we can’t show them the most relevant stories. <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/10/news-feed-fyi-building-for-all-connectivity/"">People are coming online at a staggering rate in emerging markets</a> and, in most cases, are doing so on mobile via 2G connections. To improve the Facebook experience so it works seamlessly and quickly for people in all parts of the world, we’re focused on designing News Feed to operate well regardless of device or network connection.</p>
<p>As a next step, today we are announcing ways to more efficiently show you relevant stories in your News Feed when you are on particularly slow internet connections. You can also now compose comments on posts when you are offline. The comments will appear to your friends when you next get a good internet connection.</p>
<p>None of these changes impact News Feed ranking. We are simply showing you the most relevant content as efficiently as possible. We’ll be testing and rolling this out over time to gather feedback.</p>

<p>As 2015 comes to a close, we remember what was on our minds this year and the difference we made by coming together. We’re taking a look back on the moments in 2015 that moved us and inspired us to take action.</p>
<p>We analyzed the past year’s conversation on Facebook to reveal the most talked-about global topics:</p>
<p>1. US Presidential Election<br/>
2. November 13 Attacks in Paris<br/>
3. Syrian Civil War &amp; Refugee Crisis<br/>
4. Nepal Earthquakes<br/>
5. Greek Debt Crisis<br/>
6. Marriage Equality<br/>
7. Fight Against ISIS<br/>
8. Charlie Hebdo Attack<br/>
9. Baltimore Protests<br/>
10. Charleston Shooting &amp; Flag Debate</p>
<p>To see details about each global topic and view other top 10 lists including top movies, TV shows, entertainers, athletes, places, new games, new sticker packs, as well as top topics and check-ins for many countries, visit <a href=""http://yearinreview.fb.com/""><b>yearinreview.fb.com</b></a>. Lists are also available for download at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p><b>Methodology</b><br/>
Year in Review top 10 lists were measured by how frequently a topic was mentioned in Facebook posts made between January 1 and December 1, 2015. To put this list together, Facebook posts were analyzed in an aggregated, anonymized way, and then ranked to create a snapshot of the year on Facebook.</p>

<p>As we work to improve News Feed, we make updates to the algorithm that help make sure you are seeing the most relevant stories at the top of your feed. We want to make sure that everyone who uses News Feed can understand what updates we’re making and the thinking behind them. That’s why we continue to publish News Feed FYI blog posts to explain major updates and how we’re working to get better at showing you the stories that matter most to you.</p>
<p>The actions people take on Facebook—liking, clicking, commenting or sharing a post—are some of the main factors we consider to determine what to show at the top of your News Feed. We’ve learned that honing in on how to value these signals helps make sure we show you the most relevant content.</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing effort to improve News Feed, we ask thousands of people every day to rate their experience and tell us how we can improve what they see when they check Facebook. People also take story surveys where they see two stories that could be in their News Feed and answer which they’d most want to see. We compare their answer to the order we would have put these stories in their News Feed. If the story picked is the one News Feed would have shown higher up, that’s a good sign that things are working well. If the story picked is the one we would have put lower down, this highlights an area for improvement.</p>

<p><b>Viral Stories</b><br/>
Sometimes stories on Facebook go viral, where millions of people see the same video, photo, or other post. It’s hard to predict when or why posts go viral. Sometimes this happens because lots of people are really interested in seeing that particular post. However, sometimes a post goes viral and many people tell us that they weren’t interested in seeing it, despite lots of people liking, sharing and commenting on it.</p>
<p>One example of a type of viral post that people report they don’t enjoy seeing in their News Feed are <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/01/news-feed-fyi-showing-fewer-hoaxes/"">hoaxes</a>. If there is a viral story about a hoax, it can get a lot of reshares and comments, which would normally help us infer it might be an interesting story. However, we’ve heard feedback that people don’t want to see these stories as much as other posts in their News Feed.</p>
<p>We survey tens of thousands of people every day, and for the story surveys, we ask them if they prefer a particular viral post to another post. With this update, if a significant amount of people tell us they would prefer to see other posts more than that particular viral post, we’ll take that into account when ranking, so that viral post might show up lower in people’s feeds in the future, since it might not actually be interesting to people. With the hoaxes example, if the majority of people taking the survey say they would rather see another story in their feed than the viral hoax story, then we’ll infer the story might not be as interesting, and show the viral story lower down in people’s feeds in the future.</p>
<p>If there is a viral story that people do choose to see in the survey, there will be no change to how it is ranked. As viral posts are typically anomalies, and not an important part of distribution for Pages, we don’t think this change will impact your Page’s distribution.</p>

<p>Today we’re beginning to test the ability for people to share live video on Facebook, starting with a small percentage of people in the US on iPhones. Live lets you show the people you care about what you’re seeing in real time — whether you’re visiting a new place, cooking your favorite recipe, or just want to share some thoughts. No matter where you are, Live lets you bring your friends and family right next to you to experience what’s happening together.</p>
<p>To share live video, tap on Update Status and then select the Live Video icon. You can write a quick description and choose the audience that you want to share with before going live. During your broadcast, you’ll see the number of live viewers, the names of friends who are tuning in, and a real-time stream of comments. When you end your broadcast, it will be saved on your Timeline like any other video, which you can then delete or keep for your friends to watch later.</p>
<p>You can discover live videos from your friends and <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2015/08/connect-with-public-figures-through-live/"">public figures you follow</a> right in News Feed. While watching a live video, you can tap the <a href=""http://media.fb.com/2015/11/10/updates-to-live/"">Subscribe button</a> to get notified the next time the broadcaster goes live.</p>

<p>We’re also introducing a new way to share experiences captured with your phone’s camera by grouping photos and videos that were taken together into a scrolling, moving collage. Whether you’re on a weekend trip, at a concert or just hanging out with friends, collages are a great way to share with friends and family who aren’t there with you.</p>
<p>When you tap on Photo, you’ll see recent moments from your camera roll organized into collages based on when and where you took them. You can edit your collage by adding, removing or re-arranging the photos and videos that you want to include. When you’re done, you can add a title to the collage before sharing. Collages will begin rolling out on iPhone today and will be available on Android early next year.</p>

<p>People use Facebook Groups every day to stay in touch with family, collaborate on projects, plan trips and offer support to friends.</p>
<p>Today, we’re introducing a new <a href=""http://www.facebookgroups.com"">Facebook Groups app</a> that helps people share faster and more easily with all the groups in their life. We built this app with the people who use Groups the most in mind, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Students from <a href=""http://facebookstories.com/groups"">Donda’s House</a>, an arts nonprofit in Chicago, who use groups to stay in touch during and after a 12-week music program</li>
<li>A class of <a href=""http://facebookstories.com/groups"">dental students</a> in Brazil who use a group to post notes and reminders about upcoming tests and due dates</li>
<li>Nine <a href=""http://facebookstories.com/groups"">best friends</a> spread out across Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and England who use a group to keep connected</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>When you open the app, you’ll see all your Facebook Groups in one place. Groups you use most frequently are at the top, and you can quickly move between each group.</p>

<p>MENLO PARK, Calif., Dec. 20, 2013 – Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) today announced the pricing of its underwritten registered public offering of 70,000,000 shares of its Class A common stock at a price to the public of $55.05 per share. A total of 27,004,761 shares are being offered by Facebook, and a total of 42,995,239 shares are being offered by certain selling stockholders, including 41,350,000 shares offered by Mark Zuckerberg. Closing of the offering is expected to occur on December 26, 2013, subject to customary closing conditions.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor’s, a division of McGraw-Hill Financial Inc. (S&amp;P), announced that, effective as of the close of trading on December 20, 2013, it included Facebook’s Class A common stock in the S&amp;P 500 Index, which is comprised of 500 common stocks that S&amp;P selects. Shares of Facebook’s Class A common stock will be offered primarily to index funds whose portfolios are primarily based on stocks included in the S&amp;P 500 Index.</p>
<p>Facebook intends to use the net proceeds of the offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Facebook will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. Facebook expects that the majority of the net proceeds Mr. Zuckerberg will receive upon the sale of shares in the offering will be used to satisfy taxes that he incurred in connection with his exercise, in full, of an outstanding stock option to purchase 60,000,000 shares of Class B common stock.</p>

<p>Since September, we’ve been testing a way to <a href=""https://fbnewsroomus.wordpress.com/news/2013/09/an-easier-way-to-watch-video/"">make videos more engaging on Facebook</a>, and as a result we’ve seen views, likes, shares and comments increase more than 10 percent.</p>
<p>We’re beginning to test a similar video viewing format for advertisers. Marketers will be able to use this new format to tell their stories to a large number of people on Facebook in a short amount of time – with high-quality sight, sound and motion. This approach will continue to improve the quality of ads that you see in News Feed.</p>
<p>This week, a small number of people will see video ads for the new film ‘Divergent’ begin playing as they come into view in News Feed on mobile and desktop. Here’s how it will work:</p>

<li>Rather than having to click or tap to play, videos will begin to play as they appear onscreen – without sound – similar to how they behave when shared by friends or verified Pages. If you don’t want to watch the video, you can simply scroll or swipe past it.</li>
<li>If the video is clicked or tapped and played in full screen, the sound for that video will play as well.</li>
<li>At the end of the video a carousel of two additional videos will appear, making it easy to continue to discover content from the same marketers.</li>
<li>On mobile devices, all videos that begin playing as they appear on the screen will have been downloaded in advance when the device was connected to Wi-Fi – meaning this content will not consume data plans, even if you’re not connected to Wi-Fi at the time of playback.</li>
</ul>
<div><span style=""font-family:Verdana, Arial;"">We’ll continue to refine this new way for brands to tell stories on Facebook to ensure the best experience for people and marketers.For more specifics on this feature for marketers, read our post on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/news/Testing-a-New-Way-for-Marketers-to-Tell-Stories-in-News-Feed"">Facebook for Business</a>.</span></div>
<div>
<p><b>Frequently Asked Questions</b></p>
<p>Q: Which videos start playing in News Feed?<br/>
A: At this time, videos start playing from:</p>
<p>1. Individuals (personal Facebook accounts or verified Pages)<br/>
2. Some Pages, like those of entertainers and sports organizations<br/>
3. Summit Entertainment’s content for ‘Divergent’</p>
<p>Q: Is there a way to prevent these video ads from playing as they appear on screen?<br/>
A: The video ads will begin to play as you scroll through News Feed, but if you don’t want to watch, you can simply keep scrolling and the video will stop playing. Video ads that start playing as they appear on screen within News Feed are pre-downloaded when you are on Wi-Fi so they do not consume additional data.</p>
<p>Q: When do videos play with sound?<br/>
A: Videos will not play with sound unless you turn the sound on. To do this, click or tap on the video.</p>
<p>Q: When will all video content begin to play as it appears on screen?<br/>
A: This is an initial, limited test. We will let you know if/when you’ll begin seeing more video content begin to play as it comes into view.</p>

<p class=""zw-paragraph"" style=""margin:0 0 10pt;"">Today we’re starting to roll out a new feature called Donate that lets people contribute directly to nonprofits through Facebook. The Donate feature will appear beside Posts in News Feed shared by participating nonprofits and at the top of their Facebook Pages. When people click “Donate Now” they can choose the amount, enter their payment information, and immediately donate to that cause. They also have the option to share the nonprofit’s post with their friends. We hope this will help increase donations as people encourage their friends to donate to the causes that are important to them.</p>

<p>In times of disaster or crisis, people turn to Facebook to check on loved ones, get updates, and to learn how they can help. In November 2013, in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan, <a href=""http://redcrosschat.org/2013/11/13/how-to-help-donate-to-typhoon-relief-on-facebook/"">we partnered with the International Federation of Red Cross</a> to let people donate directly to the Red Cross’s relief efforts in the Philippines. After seeing the generosity of people around the world toward this effort, we’ve been inspired to help everyone donate, at any time, to the organizations they care about most.</p>
<p>Donate also gives nonprofits an easier way to reach out and ask for help, both to support their everyday mission and in the wake of major disasters. And, with a community of over one billion people on Facebook, every local cause can become a global one — and every global cause can become a personal movement.</p>
<p>As we developed this feature, we partnered with a few nonprofits and will make it available to more organizations soon. Any nonprofit group that is interested in tapping into this new feature on Facebook can fill out the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/585894954798346"">Donate interest form</a> in the Facebook Help Center.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to make a donation to any of the following nonprofit organizations can visit their Facebook Page and start giving today.</p>

<p>Today we’re announcing Poke, an iPhone app that makes it fun and easy to say hello to friends wherever you are. The poke feature has been a part of Facebook since 2004. Now we’re excited to share a new poke experience for mobile.</p>
<p><div><img alt=""Poke"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/4313.png?w=960"" style=""width:115px;height:115px;border-width:0;border-style:solid;""/> </div>
<p>With the Poke app, you can poke or send a message, photo, or video to Facebook friends to share what you’re up to in a lightweight way. You can poke an individual friend or several at once. Each message expires after a specific time you’ve set, either 1, 3, 5 or 10 seconds. When time runs out, the message disappears from the app.  </p>
<div><img alt=""Poke"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/4315.png?w=960"" style=""width:186px;height:400px;border-width:0;border-style:solid;""/> </div>
<p>To see a message from a friend, press and hold the message until it expires. If you ever see something you’re uncomfortable with, you can click the gear menu and report it.</p>
<p>Poke will be available in the <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/app/id588594730"">App Store</a> starting later today.</p>

<p>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lessin"">Samuel W. Lessin</a></p>
<p><b>UPDATE December 20, 2012: </b>Last week we told you about some new privacy tools to help manage who can see what you share on Facebook. These tools have started rolling out globally and will begin to roll out in the US starting today.</p>
<p>We believe that the better you understand who can see the things you share, the better your experience on Facebook can be.</p>
<p>Today’s updates include Privacy Shortcuts, an easier-to-use Activity Log, and a new Request and Removal tool for managing multiple photos you’re tagged in. We’re also adding new in-product education that makes key concepts around controlling your sharing clearer, such as in-context reminders about how stuff you hide from timeline may still appear in news feed, search, and other places.</p>
<p>We continue to strive toward three main goals: bringing controls in context where you share, helping you understand what appears where as you use Facebook, and providing tools to help you act on content you don’t like.</p>
<div>
<p><b>1. In Context: More controls right where you need them</b></p>
<p><i>Privacy Shortcuts</i></p>
<p>Up until now, if you wanted to change your privacy and timeline controls on Facebook, you would need to stop what you’re doing and navigate through a separate set of pages. Today we’re announcing new shortcuts you can easily get to. Now, for key settings, you just go to the toolbar to help manage “Who can see my stuff?” “Who can contact me?” and “How do I stop someone from bothering me?” You can also access Help Center content from these shortcuts.</p>
</div>
<div><img align=""middle"" alt=""Privacy Shortcuts"" class=""alignnone"" height=""224"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/4294.png?w=730&amp;h=224"" style=""border-width:0;border-style:solid;vertical-align:middle;"" width=""730""/></div>
<p> </p>
<p>App Permissions</p>
<p>The first time you log into a new app, it asks for permission to use your info to personalize your experience. Some apps also ask to post to Facebook.</p>
<p>Before today, these two requests were part of the same screen and happened at the same time. Soon you’ll start to see these requests happen separately, so you have more control over what you share. For example, a person can grant a music app the ability to read their public profile and friends list to personalize their experience in the app, but decline to allow it to post what they listen to to Facebook on their behalf.</p>
<p>Many of the apps you use will move to this new model, but some will not – for example, games apps on Facebook.com will not change. For more information on how these new permissions will work, see our <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2012/12/12/providing-people-greater-clarity-and-control/"">developer blog</a>.</p>
<div><img align=""middle"" alt=""GDP Read"" class=""aligncenter"" height=""212"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/4297.png?w=442&amp;h=212"" style=""border-width:0;border-style:solid;vertical-align:middle;"" width=""442""/></div>
<p style=""text-align:center;""><img align=""middle"" alt=""GDP Write"" class=""aligncenter"" height=""212"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/4296.png?w=441&amp;h=212"" style=""border-width:0;border-style:solid;vertical-align:middle;"" width=""441""/></p>
<p><i>Retiring the old “Who can look up my timeline by name?” setting<br/>
</i><br/>
Facebook started as a directory service for college students, and today we offer a whole variety of services, such as news feed, photo uploads and mobile messaging. As our services have evolved, our settings have, too.</p>
<div>
<p>Everyone used to have a setting called “Who can look up my timeline by name,” which controlled if someone could be found when other people typed their name into the Facebook search bar. The setting was very limited in scope, and didn’t prevent people from finding others in many other ways across the site.</p>
<p>Because of the limited nature of the setting, we removed it for people who weren’t using it, and have built new, contextual tools, along with education about how to use them. In the coming weeks, we’ll be retiring this setting for the small percentage of people who still have it.</p>
<div></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><b><br/>
2. Understanding: In-product education</b></div>
<p>Along with the overall effort to continue bringing privacy controls up front, we’re adding in-context notices throughout Facebook. For example, we’ve created a series of messages to help you understand, in context, that the content you hide from your timeline may still appear in news feed, search and other places.</p>
<div><img align=""middle"" alt=""Hidden Education"" class=""aligncenter"" height=""392"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/4295.png?w=447&amp;h=392"" style=""border-width:0;border-style:solid;vertical-align:middle;"" width=""447""/></div>
</div>
<p><i>Updated Activity Log<br/>
</i><br/>
Last year we introduced Activity Log. Activity Log makes it easy to see the things you’ve posted on Facebook, make changes to the audience of past photos and other posts, and choose what appears on your timeline.</p>
<p>The updated Activity Log has new navigation, so you can easily review your own activity on Facebook, such as your likes and comments, photos of you, and posts you’ve been tagged in. It also has new ways to sort information, for example: Now you can quickly see public photos you’re tagged in and have hidden from your timeline, but which still appear in other places on Facebook.</p>
<p><img align=""middle"" alt=""Updated Activity Log"" class=""alignnone"" height=""299"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/4292.png?w=730&amp;h=299"" style=""border-width:0;border-style:solid;vertical-align:middle;"" width=""730""/></p>
<p><b><br/>
3. Action: New tools to manage your content New Request and Removal tool<br/>
</b><br/>
Within the updated Activity Log, you now have a Request and Removal tool for taking action on multiple photos you’re tagged in. If you spot things you don’t want on Facebook, now it’s even easier to ask the people who posted them to remove them.</p>
<p>Go to the “Photos of You” tab, select multiple photos, and ask friends to take down the shots you don’t like – you can even include a message about why this is important to you. The tool also lets you untag multiple photos at once, keeping in mind that while untagged photos don’t appear on your timeline, they can still appear in other places on Facebook, such as search, news feed, or your friends’ timelines.</p>
<p><img align=""middle"" alt=""Request Removal Tool"" class=""alignnone"" height=""459"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/4293.png?w=730&amp;h=459"" style=""border-width:0;border-style:solid;vertical-align:middle;"" width=""730""/></p>
<p>These updates and new tools will begin rolling out at the end of 2012.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, we’ve been working to improve Facebook Messenger on mobile and Facebook Messages on the web:</p>
<p><i>One ongoing conversation<br/>
</i>Now all your messages, emails, chat and text messages are combined together in one ongoing conversation, whether they’re sent from mobile or desktop.</p>
<p><i>The Other folder<br/>
</i>In 2010 we introduced the Other folder, where less relevant messages go.</p>
<p><i>Messenger for Android<br/>
</i>This month, we introduced a way to sign up for Messenger with just your name and phone number.</p>
<p><b>New filters for managing your Inbox<br/>
</b>We’ve heard that messages people care about may not always be delivered or may go unseen in the Other folder.</p>
<p>As we announced last month, we’re replacing the “Who can send me Facebook Messages” setting with up-front filters that help to address this feedback.</p>
<p>There are two options for new Inbox filtering:</p>

If you select Basic Filtering, you’ll see mostly messages from friends and people you may know (for example, friends of friends) in your Inbox. People who had the previous setting set to “friends of friends” or “everyone” will have Basic Filtering on. </span></p>
<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1""> <b>Strict Filtering</b><br/>
If you select Strict Filtering, you’ll see mostly messages from friends in your Inbox. People who had the previous setting set to “friends” will have “Strict Filtering” on. </span></p>
<p><img align=""middle"" alt=""Facebook Messages"" class=""alignnone"" height=""434"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/4311.png?w=730&amp;h=434"" style=""border-width:0;border-style:solid;vertical-align:middle;"" width=""730""/></p>
<p>With filters, the following types of messages may reach your Inbox that before would not:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""li2""><span class=""s1"">Someone using Messenger for Android, who is not on Facebook but has your contact info in their phone, wanted to send you a message</span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">A friend of a friend wanted to include you in a message about a party along with some of your mutual friends </span></li>
<li class=""li1""><span class=""s1"">A friend wanted to send a message to your @facebook.com address</span></li>
</ul>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">If you see a message from someone you don’t want to hear from in your Inbox, you can always select “Move to Other” or “Report Spam” from the Actions menu. You can also block people that you don’t want to hear from on Facebook.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1""><b>Inbox delivery test</b></span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Facebook Messages is designed to get the most relevant messages into your Inbox and put less relevant messages into your Other folder. We rely on signals about the message to achieve this goal. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Some of these signals are social – we use social signals such as friend connections to determine whether a message is likely to be one you want to see in your Inbox. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Some of these signals are algorithmic – we use algorithms to identify spam and use broader signals from the social graph, such as friend of friend connections or people you may know, to help determine relevance. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Today we’re starting a small experiment to test the usefulness of economic signals to determine relevance. This test will give a small number of people the option to pay to have a message routed to the Inbox rather than the Other folder of a recipient that they are not connected with.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">Several commentators and researchers have noted that imposing a financial cost on the sender may be the most effective way to discourage unwanted messages and facilitate delivery of messages that are relevant and useful. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This test is designed to address situations where neither social nor algorithmic signals are sufficient. For example, if you want to send a message to someone you heard speak at an event but are not friends with, or if you want to message someone about a job opportunity, you can use this feature to reach their Inbox. For the receiver, this test allows them to hear from people who have an important message to send them.</span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">This message routing feature is only for personal messages between individuals in the U.S. In this test, the number of messages a person can have routed from their Other folder to their Inbox will be limited to a maximum of one per week. </span></p>
<p class=""p1""><span class=""s1"">We’ll continue to iterate and evolve Facebook Messages over the coming months. </span></p>

<p class=""p1""><em>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/elliot"">Elliot Schrage</a>, Vice President, Communications, Public Policy and Marketing</em></p>
<p>Yesterday we concluded our seven-day global site governance vote on the proposed updates to our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (SRR) and Data Use Policy.</p>
<p class=""p1"">An external auditor has reviewed and confirmed the final results. Of the 668,872 people who voted, 589,141 recommended we keep our existing SRR and Data Use Policy. We made substantial efforts to inform our users and encourage them to vote, both through emails and their news feeds. Despite these efforts and widespread media coverage, less than one percent of our user community of more than one billion participated. As stated in both policies, the results are advisory unless more than 30% of users vote.</p>
<p class=""p1"">While participation in the vote was minimal, this experience illustrated the clear value of our notice and comment process. Your substantive feedback on our proposals during the seven-day comment period, along with discussions with our global regulators, resulted in clarifications and revisions to those proposals. For example, we added new language to clarify our proposed updates on sharing information with our affiliates and our privacy controls. After considering these factors, we have decided to adopt the proposed updates to our SRR and Data Use Policy. You can view the final documents, which will go into effect today, by using the following links: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/terms.php"">Statement of Rights and R</a>esponsibilities and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/"">Data Use Policy</a>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">We understand that many of you feel strongly about maintaining the participatory nature of our site governance process. We do too. We believe that having a meaningful dialogue with our community through our notice and comment process is core to that effort moving forward. We also plan to explore and implement new, innovative and effective ways to enhance this process in order to maximize user engagement.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Thank you again for participating in our site governance process. We hope you’ll stay vocal and involved. You can like the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/fbprivacy"">Facebook and Privacy Page</a> to learn more about upcoming opportunities to communicate with us about protecting your information on Facebook.

<p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/about/timeline"">Timeline</a> gives you an easy way to see the things you’ve shared, and collect all your best moments in a single place. In addition to <a href=""https://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150408488962131"">making timeline available on the web</a><em> </em>, today we’re also launching timeline on Android and m.facebook.com.</p>

<p>Mobile timeline starts with your unique cover photo. As you scroll down, you’ll see your posts, photos and life events as they happened, back to the day you were born. Photo albums and other posts are horizontally swipeable, so you can quickly view multiple photos or posts inline without leaving timeline. You can also swipe through the views at the top of your timeline to navigate to your map, photos, subscribers and more.</p>
<p><strong>Making stories more visual</strong></p>
<p>Your posts now appear in several different ways on your mobile timeline. The photos you share are bigger, and friends you’re with and places you visit appear on a map.</p>

<p>We <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150289612087131"">recently announced</a> our plans to introduce <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/about/timeline"">Facebook Timeline</a>, an entirely new kind of profile.</p>
<p>Timeline gives you an easy way to rediscover the things you shared, and collect your most important moments. It also lets you share new experiences, like the music you listen to or the miles you run.</p>
<p>Starting today, timeline is now available everywhere. Here are some tips to help you get started.</p>
<p style=""text-align:center;""><img align=""middle"" alt=""Timeline Worldwide"" class=""aligncenter"" height=""395"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/1907.jpg?w=720&amp;h=395"" style=""border-width:0;border-style:solid;vertical-align:middle;"" width=""720""/></p>
<p><strong>7-day preview period</strong></p>
<p>When you upgrade to timeline, you’ll have seven days to review everything that appears on your timeline before anyone else can see it. You can also choose to publish your timeline at any time during the review period. If you decide to wait, your timeline will go live automatically after seven days. Your new timeline will replace your profile, but all your stories and photos will still be there.</p>
<p>If you want to see how your timeline appears to other people, click the gear menu at the top of your timeline, and select “View As.” You can choose to see how your timeline appears to a specific friend or the public.</p>
<p style=""text-align:center;""><img align=""middle"" alt=""Timeline Worldwide"" class=""aligncenter"" height=""142"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/1908.jpg?w=241&amp;h=142"" style=""border-width:0;border-style:solid;vertical-align:middle;"" width=""241""/></p>

<p><strong>Feature or hide stories</strong></p>
<p>As you explore your timeline, you may see stories that you want to feature, like your graduation or the day you bought your first car. There might also be stuff that you want to remove or hide from your timeline.</p>
<p>To feature something on your timeline, roll over the story and click the star to expand it to two columns. Or you can click the pencil to hide, delete or edit a post.</p>
<p style=""text-align:center;""><img align=""middle"" alt=""Timeline Worldwide"" class=""aligncenter"" height=""181"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/1910.jpg?w=449&amp;h=181"" style=""border-width:0;border-style:solid;vertical-align:middle;"" width=""449""/></p>
<p>Use the privacy dropdown to adjust who can see any of your posts. You can even select “Only Me” for posts you want to keep but don’t want others to see.</p>
<p style=""text-align:center;""><img align=""middle"" alt=""Timeline Worldwide"" class=""aligncenter"" height=""284"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/1911.jpg?w=476&amp;h=284"" style=""border-width:0;border-style:solid;vertical-align:middle;"" width=""476""/></p>
<p><strong>See all your activity</strong></p>
<p>With timeline, now you have access to a new tool called Activity Log. Your activity log is a place where you can review all your posts and activity, from today back to when you first started using Facebook. Only you can see your activity log.</p>
<p>You’ll see two dropdown menus next to each story in your activity log. The first lets you see and adjust the privacy of a post. The second lets you decide if you want the post to appear on your timeline. You can feature, hide or delete any of your posts.</p>
<p>To quickly find a certain type of story, click the “All” dropdown at the top of your activity log and select what you’re looking for. For example, you can choose to see only photos or posts from apps.</p>
<p style=""text-align:center;""><img align=""middle"" alt=""Timeline Worldwide"" class=""aligncenter"" height=""425"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/1912.jpg?w=720&amp;h=425"" style=""border-width:0;border-style:solid;vertical-align:middle;"" width=""720""/></p>

<p>To get timeline, simply go to the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/about/timeline"">Introducing Timeline</a> page and click “Get Timeline.” Or you can wait until you see an announcement at the top of your profile.</p>

<p>NEW YORK – December 2, 2011 – To keep up with its rapid growth, Facebook today announced plans to establish an engineering presence in New York City and tap into the remarkable technical talent that the region has to offer. The Facebook NYC engineering office, the company’s first outside the West Coast, will open in early 2012 and will begin accepting applications immediately.</p>
<p>“More than 800 million people around the world rely on Facebook, and more than half of them visit every day. Operating at such a large scale, and innovating as quickly as we do, we need to recruit the most talented engineers in the world,” said Mike Schroepfer, Facebook’s Vice President of Engineering. “New York has a strong history of innovation and is home to thousands of talented technical people, and we want them to help us solve the challenges of designing and building the next generation of Facebook,” he added.</p>
<p>“Building an engineering presence outside the West Coast is a big step for us, one we would take only if we found the right combination of talent and community support,” said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s Chief Operating Officer. “We’re particularly grateful for the encouragement and assistance of New York’s elected leaders, who understand what it takes to build a climate where technology can fuel economic growth and the creation of high skilled jobs,” she added.</p>
<p>“Facebook is capitalizing on what more and more tech companies are realizing: that New York City is the best place in the world to recruit and retain a talented workforce,” said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. “The growth in the tech sector is creating jobs and further diversifying our economy. That’s why we are invested in expanding our engineering workforce by building a new applied sciences school in the city. We want to do everything we can to make sure that Facebook can grow here, and that the next Facebook will be founded here.”</p>
<p>“New York is pleased to call Facebook a ‘friend’ and welcomes their decision to expand by hiring engineers who will help to continue fueling innovation in the greatest city in the world,” said U.S. Senator Charles E. Schumer. “There is so much to like about Facebook’s decision to grow in New York, most importantly is the fact that as the largest city in America, New York can offer up the greatest and most diverse talent pool in the country to the most successful social media company in the world.”</p>
<p>“Facebook has been at the forefront of social media innovation and its engineering presence here will create jobs and help position New York City to lead in the high-tech economy of the future,” said U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. “Our city is home to some of the world’s brightest minds and best ideas to grow our economy. And we must continue to cultivate our city’s talent pool and businesses to become tomorrow’s innovators.”</p>
<p>“I’m thrilled to welcome Facebook’s new engineering team to the East Side – and to the superb web talent pool of New York City,” said U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney.</p>
<p>“Under Governor Cuomo’s leadership, world-renowned companies like Facebook are once again seeing New York as a premier place to grow and invest,” said Kenneth Adams, President, CEO, and Commissioner at Empire State Development. “I thank Facebook for their commitment to New York and welcome them as another innovative partner to help grow our economy.”</p>
<p>The office will be led by Serkan Piantino, an engineering manager at Facebook who previously managed the engineering team behind Facebook’s News Feed and built the infrastructure behind Timeline. He currently manages the engineering teams that power Facebook Messages and Chat. Serkan holds a B.S. in Computer Science from Carnegie Mellon University.

<p><em>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/zuck?ref=blog"">Mark Zuckerberg</a></em></p>
<p>I founded Facebook on the idea that people want to share and connect with people in their lives, but to do this everyone needs complete control over who they share with at all times.</p>
<p>This idea has been the core of Facebook since day one. When I built the first version of Facebook, almost nobody I knew wanted a public page on the internet. That seemed scary. But as long as they could make their page private, they felt safe sharing with their friends online. Control was key. With Facebook, for the first time, people had the tools they needed to do this. That’s how Facebook became the world’s biggest community online. We made it easy for people to feel comfortable sharing things about their real lives.</p>
<p>We’ve added many new tools since then: sharing photos, creating groups, commenting on and liking your friends’ posts and recently even listening to music or watching videos together. With each new tool, we’ve added new privacy controls to ensure that you continue to have complete control over who sees everything you share. Because of these tools and controls, most people share many more things today than they did a few years ago.</p>
<p>Overall, I think we have a good history of providing transparency and control over who can see your information.</p>
<p>That said, I’m the first to admit that we’ve made a bunch of mistakes. In particular, I think that a small number of high profile mistakes, like Beacon four years ago and poor execution as we transitioned our privacy model two years ago, have often overshadowed much of the good work we’ve done.</p>
<p>I also understand that many people are just naturally skeptical of what it means for hundreds of millions of people to share so much personal information online, especially using any one service. Even if our record on privacy were perfect, I think many people would still rightfully question how their information was protected. It’s important for people to think about this, and not one day goes by when I don’t think about what it means for us to be the stewards of this community and their trust.</p>
<p>Facebook has always been committed to being transparent about the information you have stored with us – and we have led the internet in building tools to give people the ability to see and control what they share.</p>
<p>But we can also always do better. I’m committed to making Facebook the leader in transparency and control around privacy.</p>
<p>As we have grown, we have tried our best to listen closely to the people who use Facebook. We also work with regulators, advocates and experts to inform our privacy practices and policies. Recently, the US Federal Trade Commission established agreements with Google and Twitter that are helping to shape new privacy standards for our industry. Today, the FTC announced <a href=""http://ftc.gov/opa/2011/11/privacysettlement.shtm"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">a similar agreement with Facebook</a>. These agreements create a framework for how companies should approach privacy in the United States and around the world.</p>
<p>For Facebook, this means we’re making a clear and formal long-term commitment to do the things we’ve always tried to do and planned to keep doing — giving you tools to control who can see your information and then making sure only those people you intend can see it.</p>
<p>In the last 18 months alone, we’ve announced more than 20 new tools and resources designed to give you more control over your Facebook experience. Some of the things these include are:</p>
<p>• An easier way to <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150251867797131"">select your audience</a> when making a new post</p>
<p>• <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434691727130"">Inline privacy controls</a> on all your existing posts</p>
<p>• The <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150251867797131"">ability to review tags</a> made by others before they appear on your profile</p>
<p>• <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150278932602131"">Friend lists</a> that are easier to create and that maintain themselves automatically</p>
<p>• A <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434700832130"">new groups product</a> for sharing with smaller sets of people</p>
<p>• A tool to view your profile as someone else would see it</p>
<p>• Tools to ensure your information stays secure like <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=10150153272607131"">double login approval</a></p>
<p>• <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=413846952130"">Mobile versions</a> of your privacy controls</p>
<p>• An easy way to download all your Facebook data</p>
<p>• A <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=434691727130"">new apps dashboard</a> to control what your apps can access</p>
<p>• A <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=403443752130"">new app permission dialog</a> that gives you clear control over what an app can do anytime you add one</p>
<p>• Many more <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/blog.php?post=381246352130"">privacy education resources</a></p>
<p>As a matter of fact, privacy is so deeply embedded in all of the development we do that every day tens of thousands of servers worth of computational resources are consumed checking to make sure that on any webpage we serve, that you have access to see each of the sometimes hundreds or even thousands of individual pieces of information that come together to form a Facebook page. This includes everything from every post on a page to every tag in those posts to every mutual friend shown when you hover over a person’s name. We do privacy access checks literally tens of billions of times each day to ensure we’re enforcing that only the people you want see your content. These privacy principles are written very deeply into our code.</p>
<p>Even before the agreement announced by the FTC today, Facebook had already proactively addressed many of the concerns the FTC raised. For example, their complaint to us mentioned our Verified Apps Program, which we canceled almost two years ago in December 2009. The same complaint also mentions cases where advertisers inadvertently received the ID numbers of some users in referrer URLs. We fixed that problem over a year ago in May 2010.</p>
<p>In addition to these product changes, the FTC also recommended improvements to our internal processes. We’ve embraced these ideas, too, by agreeing to improve and formalize the way we do privacy review as part of our ongoing product development process. As part of this, we will establish a biennial independent audit of our privacy practices to ensure we’re living up to the commitments we make.</p>
<p>Even further, effective today I am creating two new corporate officer roles to make sure our commitments will be reflected in what we do internally — in the development of our products and the security of our systems — and externally — in the way we work collaboratively with regulators, government agencies and privacy groups from around the world:</p>
<p>– Erin Egan will become Chief Privacy Officer, Policy. Erin recently joined Facebook after serving as a partner and co-chair of the global privacy and data security practice of Covington &amp; Burling, the respected international law firm. Throughout her career, Erin has been deeply involved in legislative and regulatory efforts to address privacy, data security, spam, spyware and other consumer protection issues. Erin will lead our engagement in the global public discourse and debate about online privacy and ensure that feedback from regulators, legislators, experts and academics from around the world is incorporated into Facebook’s practices and policies.</p>
<p>– Michael Richter will become Chief Privacy Officer, Products. Michael is currently Facebook’s Chief Privacy Counsel on our legal team. In his new role, Michael will join our product organization to expand, improve and formalize our existing program of internal privacy review. He and his team will work to ensure that our principles of user control, privacy by design and transparency are integrated consistently into both Facebook’s product development process and our products themselves.</p>
<p>These two positions will further strengthen the processes that ensure that privacy control is built into our products and policies. I’m proud to have two such strong individuals with so much privacy expertise serving in these roles.</p>
<p>Today’s announcement formalizes our commitment to providing you with control over your privacy and sharing — and it also provides protection to ensure that your information is only shared in the way you intend. As the founder and CEO of Facebook, I look forward to working with the Commission as we implement this agreement. It is my hope that this agreement makes it clear that Facebook is the leader when it comes to offering people control over the information they share online.</p>
<p>Finally, I also want to reaffirm the commitment I made when I first launched Facebook. We will serve you as best we can and work every day to provide you with the best tools for you to share with each other and the world. We will continue to improve the service, build new ways for you to share and offer new ways to protect you and your information better than any other company in the world.</p>

<p>We’re excited to announce an update to Photos that makes it faster and easier to share photos on Facebook. Now, when you upload photos to an album, you can see each photo as it uploads and watch the upload progress in real-time.  In addition, we’ve made some improvements so you don’t have to wait for the album to finish uploading to start adding details and stories. Now, you can start adding captions and location details to each of your photos right away.  You can also add an album title, description, and location at the top of the uploader. Just as before, you can choose who can see your album before you post and adjust your selection later if you change your mind.  You can also continue to track how long your upload will take.</p>
<p>If you don’t see this version of the Photos uploader yet, you can expect to see it over the coming weeks as the rollout continues.</p>

<p>October 28, 2010. Yandex, Russia’s largest search engine, and Facebook have signed a partnership agreement whereby Yandex will integrate information from the social network on its website.</p>
<p>Yandex makes its services more attractive for the users of social networks, including those with a Facebook account. So, the portal’s front page hosts a Facebook widget and the company’s own instant messaging service Ya.Online informs its users of new notifications on the networking website. In addition, Yandex will now add the data from Facebook into its blog search index improving its international search and boosting new, recently created pages’ indexing. Specifically, Facebook will provide Yandex with a syndication feed that gathers information about updates on its Pages and profiles created to represent public figures, businesses or organisations.</p>
<p>Yandex has long been incorporating social content into its search by indexing pages of key Russian-language blog-hosting websites and micro-blogging services, including LiveJournal.com, Twitter.com and LiveInternet.ru so that Yandex web search nowadays highlights user profiles hosted on most social networks. Yandex search can offer to its users the freshest and the most comprehensive social content from the above mentioned social networks and blog-hosting websites that partner with the company to have their data automatically added to the search engine’s index.</p>
<p>“Social networks are becoming more open to the outside world and it’s a win-win situation for everyone,’ says Roman Ivanov, Head of Communication Services at Yandex. ‘Social networking web-sites get more traffic and new users, and search engines obtain a whole load of information that boosts the search quality. We anticipate user interest in social and personal search to keep growing”.</p>
<p>“We feel that this partnership will bring a lot of value for our Russian users as we would like the public information on Facebook to be easily searchable via Yandex,” adds Javier Olivan, Head of International at Facebook.</p>

<p>Collaboration committed to educating kids, parents and teachers about responsible and safe Internet use</p>
<p>Memphis, Tenn. and Palo Alto, Calif. – June 10, 2010– Today, National PTA and Facebook announced a formal collaboration to promote responsible and safe Internet use to kids, parents and teachers. Together, National PTA and Facebook will establish a comprehensive program that will provide information, support and news to encourage citizenship online, reduce cyberbullying and advance Internet safety and security.</p>
<p>The partnership is founded on the belief that awareness is essential to supporting safe and responsible Internet use. Thus, in addition to creating comprehensive and engaging resources, PTA and Facebook are committing to aggressively promoting Internet safety information to their respective audiences. National PTA will use its Website (www.pta.org), and actively reach out to the 24,000 local PTAs across the country with a goal of reaching every American public school. Facebook will raise awareness of the resources among the hundreds of millions of parents, teachers and children using its service through an in-kind Facebook commitment equivalent to $1 million and promotion on other parts of the site, including the safety center.</p>
<p>The announcement kicks off the National PTA convention in Memphis, Tenn. which marks the 40-year anniversary of the union of two parent associations dedicated to children and when the National PTA became a desegregated association. At the convention, PTA is reaffirming its commitment to closing the achievement gap between students of different ethnicities and economic backgrounds. Recognizing that disparities exist not only in students’ access to technology but also in their access to related education materials, the partnership extends these efforts. As part of the agreement, both PTA and Facebook are committed to working to shrink the digital divide, by reaching families, regardless of income or race and providing them with tools and resources to keep them digitally smart on-line.</p>
<p>“Our vision is that each child, parent and teacher will have the knowledge and tools they need to harness the power of the Internet effectively – and safely,” says Charles J. “Chuck” Saylors, National PTA President. “Today, as we kick off National PTA’s convention in Memphis, we are announcing a partnership that will provide parents all across the nation with the knowledge, tools and resources they need to keep their children safe in this ever-changing technological society.”</p>
<p>“Nothing is more important to us than the safety and well being of the people, especially the many teenagers, who use Facebook,” says Sheryl Sandberg, Chief Operating Officer of Facebook. “Only through the constant and concerted effort of parents, teachers, law enforcement and industry can we keep kids safe and help them develop into tomorrow’s leaders. We are proud to be working with National PTA toward that goal.”</p>
<p>The partnership builds on National PTA’s 114-year history of advocacy on behalf of children and Facebook’s efforts to create a trusted environment for its more than 400 million users. As was the case with the recently redesigned Facebook Safety Center, Facebook and PTA will consult with many child safety, education and technology experts to collect, build and maintain a comprehensive set of multi-media education resources for this initiative. The process will include significant input from Facebook’s global Safety Advisory Board.</p>

<p><em>Simplifies Choices and Offers More Powerful Controls</em></p>
<p>PALO ALTO, Calif., May 26 — Facebook today responded to user comments and concerns about privacy by announcing it will introduce simpler and more powerful controls for sharing personal information. New settings will give the more than 400 million people who use Facebook the power to control exactly who can see the information and content they share, all with just a few simple clicks. In addition, new settings will be added to make it easier to turn off third-party applications or websites. Facebook Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg officially announced the changes in a blog post today at <a href=""http://blog.facebook.com/"">blog.facebook.com</a>.</p>
<p>“When we started Facebook, we built it around a few simple ideas,” said Zuckerberg. “When people have control over what they share, they want to share more. When people share more, the world becomes more open and connected. Over the past few weeks, the number one thing we’ve heard is that many users want a simpler way to control their information. Today we’re starting to roll out changes that will make our controls simpler and easier.”</p>
<p>The company’s new privacy controls reflect wide-ranging consultation with the office of Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) and a number of online privacy and consumer advocacy groups. These include the Center for Democracy and Technology, Consumer Action, Future of Privacy Forum, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Progress and Freedom Foundation, NetChoice, CATO Institute, TRUSTe, Technology Policy Institute, and Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. The consultations have proven extremely helpful in both clarifying and communicating Facebook’s privacy principles, and have greatly contributed to the design and implementation of the new privacy controls. These updated controls will start rolling out today and will be live for all Facebook users in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg first announced Facebook’s intention to make these changes in a <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/23/AR2010052303828.html"">Washington Post op-ed</a> that detailed principles by which Facebook operates:</p>
<ol>
<li>People have control over how their information is shared.</li>
<li>Facebook does not share personal information with people or services users don’t want.</li>
<li>Facebook does not give advertisers access to people’s personal information.</li>
<li>Facebook does not sell any of people’s information to anyone.</li>
<li>Facebook will always be a free service for everyone.</li>
</ol>
<p>Today’s announcement focuses on the first two of these principles.</p>
<p><strong>Making Control Simple</strong></p>
<p><em>One control for content</em>: A new simple control makes it easy to share on Facebook with friends, friends of friends or everyone—all with just one click. The corresponding settings are immediately applied and displayed in an easy-to-understand grid. At the same time, Facebook has maintained its more granular settings for those who want to customize their level of sharing. These settings now all appear on a single page for easier access.</p>
<p><em>Retroactive control</em>: People who choose the more restrictive “Friends Only” or “Friends of Friends” options with the simple control will have the corresponding setting for all the content they posted previously for sharing. Thus, a person can make all the content they’ve ever shared on Facebook more private with just a couple of clicks.</p>
<p><em>Future products</em>: Facebook commits to carry over people’s privacy choices for new products that facilitate sharing. Thus, if someone chooses “Friends Only” for “Sharing on Facebook,” new products that have privacy settings will be automatically set to “Friends Only.” This means Facebook users don’t have to worry about new settings in the future.</p>
<p><em>Prioritizing simplicity</em>: Granularity of control has always been a primary objective in Facebook’s privacy design. Starting with the changes announced today, the company will also prioritize ease-of-use in its privacy design.</p>
<p><em>Fewer privacy changes</em>: Facebook’s goal is to make privacy-related changes with less frequency and to work within the framework announced today as it continues to innovate new features and products.</p>
<p><strong>Less Publicly Available Information</strong></p>
<p><em>Significantly less public information</em>: Facebook has drastically reduced the amount of information that is available to everyone. This information is now limited to name, profile picture (should a user choose to have one), gender (though this can be hidden on the profile), and networks (should the user join any).</p>
<p><em>Privacy controls for Pages</em>: Connections to Pages, which were previously available to everyone, will have privacy settings that work for both ends of the connection. People can prevent others from seeing Pages on their profile and from seeing them in the “People who like this” boxes on the Pages themselves. Applications will also need to ask for explicit permission in order to access any of your Pages that are not visible to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Easier Opt Outs</strong></p>
<p><em>Full control over how applications and websites on Facebook Platform access information</em>: In response to requests, Facebook has added a simple way for people to completely turn off Platform applications and websites, so that your information is not shared with applications, even information available to everyone.</p>
<p><em>Easier opt-out of Instant Personalization Pilot Program</em>: Facebook has also made it easier for people to turn off the instant personalization program, which prevents those, and any future, applications in the program from accessing their information.</p>
<p><em>Granular data permissions for applications and websites</em>: Facebook also highlighted the new controls users have over information shared with applications and websites on Facebook Platform. With the new data permissions model, applications must obtain specific approval before gaining access to any personal information that a user has not made available to “Everyone.”</p>
<p><strong>What People Are Saying</strong></p>
<p>“Facebook’s users have spoken and made it clear that they want control of their information. Despite all rumors to the contrary, privacy is not dead, it is on its way to a comeback in the form of simplified controls and better policies,” said Leslie Harris, President, Center for Democracy and Technology. “While more work still needs to be done, these changes are the building blocks to giving people what they want and deserve.”</p>
<p>“People care about privacy now more than ever. We are pleased that Facebook has pledged to improve user control and choice and we look forward to working together to help them follow through on this commitment,” said Michelle De Mooy, Senior Associate at Consumer Action. “We believe the company must work with a broad coalition of consumer and privacy advocates, regulators, and legislators in order to raise the bar and lead the industry toward empowering and protecting consumers online. We also hope that this step forward from Facebook will send a message to industry that strong privacy standards aren’t just good policy, they’re good business.”</p>
<p>“The message that all companies should be taking away from this is that managing digital identity is critically important to Internet users of all ages and backgrounds. Facebook is taking steps that are essential for user trust by providing users with additional control over the personal data they share. As sites, services and devices grow increasingly complex, the challenge for Facebook and for others going forward is to continue to seek innovations that ensure that privacy tools can be intuitive for users,” said Jules Polonetsky, Director, Future of Privacy Forum.</p>
<p>“Facebook’s announcement should remind us all that online services actively compete in the market of public opinion based on their commitment to empowering users to make their own choices about privacy,” said Berin Szoka, Senior Fellow and Director of the Center for Internet Freedom at Progress and Freedom Foundation. “Facebook has affirmed that commitment by responding to user demands to allow users to restrict visibility of their friends and their ‘likes,’ and to opt-out completely from sharing of information with third-party applications and external websites. Just as important is the improved user interface, which maximizes both granularity of user control and ease of use—two things that are always in tension. Achieving both complexity and simplicity requires ongoing, iterative process of innovation.”</p>
<p>“These new features give consumers more choice and more control over their information—a win for both Facebook and its users,” said Daniel Castro, Senior Analyst for the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “Facebook’s latest changes show that companies are responding appropriately to their customers’ concerns about privacy. In this case, market and customer feedback are more effective tools for meeting consumer needs than heavy-handed privacy regulations that would only impede innovation.”</p>
<p>“Providing people with true privacy choices that are both simple and transparent is no easy task. Facebook’s changes to make its privacy settings more accessible, as well as to provide broader opt-out choices, reflect both the company’s deep commitment to control and its ability to quickly innovate and incorporate feedback,” said Fran Maier, President of TRUSTe. “We will continue to work closely with Facebook to ensure that it lives up to the commitments it has made to its users.”</p>

<li>Significantly reduced the amount of information that is always visible to everyone. Friends and Pages (your connections) can now be restricted to anyone you want. To help people recognize you, your name, profile picture, networks, and gender are always open to everyone (though half of these you don’t need to add).</li>
<li>Given you more control over how applications and websites access your information. Now you can completely turn off Facebook Platform applications and websites, which means that your information will not be shared with applications. We also made it very simple to turn off instant personalization. You can ensure that your information is not shared with current or future instant personalization applications by un-checking the box to “Enable instant personalization”.</li>
<li>Get a better understanding of how you like to share on Facebook. The new presets help us understand the overall privacy level you’re comfortable with for the things you share. As we roll out new products, we want to apply the right setting for you at the outset—eliminating the need for you to check your setting each time a new feature is introduced. We’re committed to carrying over your presets for new products that facilitate sharing. So, if you choose the “Friends Only” preset for “Sharing on Facebook”, new products that have privacy settings will be automatically set to “Friends Only” as well.</li>
<li>Not changing anything about our advertising programs: we never sell any of your personal information to anyone. There’s a rumor that the more openly you share your information the more money we make, but it’s just wrong. Advertisers may target ads to people according to certain demographics, but they receive only anonymous data reports. We don’t share your personal information with our advertisers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data points</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced the number of settings required to make all information private from nearly 50 to less than 15.</li>
<li>Introduced presets that cover 18 individual settings for sharing with one single control—two clicks to control what had been more than 100 different options.</li>
<li>Consolidated 10 settings on 3 separate pages into 7 settings on one page.</li>
<li>Reduced the number of separate pages in privacy center from 13 to 8.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>FAQ</strong></p>
<p>Q. How are users being informed of these changes?</p>
<p>As we roll this out, we will be posting a message to all users on the homepage pointing them to information that explains the changes. In addition, we have and will continue to devote significant resources to educating people about the control they have on Facebook. Before rolling out these changes we will update our robust privacy education materials, including a new privacy guide (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation.php"">http://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation.php</a>), instructional videos posted to our blog and Facebook Page, and numerous FAQs in our Help Center. Finally, we are committed to working with non-profit organizations to raise awareness among their constituents.</p>
<p>Q. Were users involved in this redesign?</p>
<p>Yes, we incorporated four rounds of iterative user testing into the redesign process. In each of these tests we worked with a variety of users, from those that classified themselves as very open to those that classified themselves as very closed. In each round of testing users were given a variety of tasks to measure both their understanding of the features, as well as their experience using the privacy controls. We then continuously modified the explanatory language, the placement and the visual presentation of the controls based on the users’ experiences.</p>
<p>Q. Where can people provide feedback on these changes?</p>
<p>We hope these changes demonstrate the tremendous respect we have for the hundreds of millions of people who use Facebook every day, and our commitment to ensuring that each of these people continues to feel comfortable sharing and connecting. Today, as always, we encourage our users to submit their thoughts and feedback: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/privacyfeedback"">http://www.facebook.com/privacyfeedback</a></p>
<p>Q. How soon until everyone gets the new privacy settings?</p>
<p>We are working hard to make the simpler privacy controls available to everyone as soon as possible. However, as is our standard practice with most products we launch, we will begin with a slow roll out and will gradually increase the number of people who with new controls. This process started today and will be complete in the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>First initiative with global board brings new safety content to parents, educators, teens and law enforcement</p>
<p>PALO ALTO, Calif. – April 13, 2010 — In its latest effort to build and sustain a trusted environment for its 400 million users worldwide, Facebook today launched a completely redesigned Safety Center with new resources designed to inform parents, educators, teens, and members of the law enforcement community about Facebook’s tools for staying safe while using the service. The initiative is the first major collaboration between Facebook and its global Safety Advisory Board, which it convened in December 2009.</p>
<p>As more people bring their social connections online, understanding best practices for staying safe on Facebook is as important as learning not to talk to strangers or rules of the road. The new Safety Center, which the company has been testing in recent weeks, is designed to meet these needs through zeroing in on the following key components: – Robust content: four times the number of pages dedicated to safety topics than was previously available – Interactive portal: rich multimedia content drawn from Facebook resources as well as independent organizations that seek to educate people about staying safe online – Streamlined design: clean, navigable interface created to help people quickly find answers to important safety questions organized by topic, such as “Addressing Personal Safety” and “Responding to Objectionable Content”</p>
<p>Facebook worked directly with its Safety Advisory Board on the initiative. The board provided expert advice on topics to address within the Center, including defense against cyberbullying; how to report a policy violation to Facebook; and information for educators on using the service. The Safety Center also includes content for parents developed by Common Sense Media, a member of its Safety Advisory Board, on topics such as “How do I teach my teen to use the Internet wisely?” and “Can I ‘friend’ my teen on Facebook?” This comes as part of a partnership between Facebook and Common Sense Media to promote digital literacy across the Internet.</p>
<p>Facebook also used the European Union’s Safer Social Networking Principles, a set of recommended best practices adopted by the social networking industry in consultation with the European Commission, to inform the new design.</p>
<p>“There’s no single answer to making the Internet or Facebook safer,” says said Elliot Schrage, Vice-President of Global Communications and Public Policy at Facebook. “That’s why we’re introducing new tools and advice for parents, educators and teens. We want our approach for improving safety to be as simple, easy and effective as our approach to improving Facebook’s user experience. Our Safety Advisory Board has been a tremendous resource in developing this next generation of safety resources and offering us ideas for new initiatives. Going forward, you’ll see even more powerful – and simpler – safety innovations coming from Facebook.”</p>
<p>“WiredSafety, along with our Teenangels and StopCyberbullying programs, is dedicated to providing all Internet users with the most robust safety information available,” said Parry Aftab, Executive Director of WiredSafety. “The development of Facebook’s new safety page is a positive and proactive step towards giving Facebook users the information they need to keep themselves safe online. We applaud their efforts and look forward to continued collaboration on this and other safety initiatives.”</p>
<p>“On the user-driven Web, safety has to be a collaboration,” said Anne Collier, Co-Director of ConnectSafely.org . “ConnectSafely is pleased to have helped develop Facebook’s new Safety Center, and we look forward to continuing efforts to engage users in helping to make the social Web a safe, enjoyable place for them and all their friends.”</p>
<p>“It is so important for Facebook to have clear, accessible and prominent safety advice.” said Will Gardner, CEO of Childnet International. “We are delighted to have been able to advise Facebook on the latest updates to their safety pages, and to have helped to shape the start of an ongoing process to help users understand more clearly what the rules are for their engagement and how to stay safe and keep in control in this environment.”</p>
<p>“Technology provides kids with new and exciting opportunities to share and communicate, but it is up to parents, educators, industry leaders, business, and policymakers to give kids clear-cut information on how to navigate both the possibilities and the perils of the digital world,” said Anne Zehren, president and COO of Common Sense Media. “We feel it’s vitally important that Facebook is stepping up to connect parents and teens around the globe with the support and education they need to make smart and responsible choices that will allow them to thrive in a world of media and technology.”</p>
<p>“We’re encouraged to see Facebook taking a thoughtful, proactive approach to safety on the web” said Stephen Balkam, CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute. “Education is one of the four pillars of what we do at FOSI, and we are confident that the new Safety Center on Facebook will demonstrate the progress that can be made by bringing together safety organizations and Facebook technology in a concerted effort to reach families who now use the Internet as part of their everyday lives.”</p>
<p>The launch of the improved Safety Center is the latest component of an aggressive global safety strategy for the company. In December, the New York Attorney General’s office brought attention to Facebook’s cooperation in identifying and disabling the accounts of registered sex offenders. In early 2008, Facebook signed an agreement with 49 Attorneys General to help protect children from online predators. Facebook also participated in the Internet Safety Technical Task Force, a group of Internet businesses, non-profit organizations, academics, and technology experts that worked together to identify effective tools and technologies to create a safer environment on the Internet for youth. In November, the company partnered with MTV on its “A Thin Line” campaign to prevent digital abuse and worked with the BBC to promote its “Bullyproof” campaign to end cyberbullying. Facebook regularly invites safety organizations like the National Crime Prevention Council to blog about safety for its users, and maintains an active campaign of safety outreach to schools and community groups. The company is also a founding member of stopcyberbullying.org , which seeks to combat cyberbullying.</p>
<p>The Facebook Safety Advisory Board comprises five leading Internet safety organizations from North America and Europe that serve in a consultative capacity to the company on issues related to online safety. The organizations on the board are Common Sense Media, ConnectSafely, WiredSafety, Childnet International and The Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI).</p>

<p><strong>PALO ALTO, Calif. and SAN JOSE, Calif.</strong> — February 18, 2010 — Facebook and PayPal today announced a strategic relationship to offer PayPal in key parts of Facebook’s advertising and developer systems. </p>
<p>As part of the relationship, advertisers around the world will soon be able to use PayPal to pay for Facebook Ads through the company’s online advertising tool. For businesses in areas where the payment process can be difficult and expensive, the option to pay with PayPal makes it even easier for advertisers, particularly small international companies, to run campaigns on Facebook. Facebook reaches more than 400 million people, 70 percent of whom live outside the United States. </p>
<p>In addition, PayPal will become a payment option for Facebook Credits, which is currently being tested in a small number of games and applications. The goal of Facebook Credits is to give users a fast and easy way to buy virtual goods on Facebook, including items from the Facebook Gift Shop. </p>
<p>“We want to give the people who use Facebook, as well as advertisers and developers, a fast and trusted way to pay across our service,” said Dan Levy, director of payment operations, Facebook. “As our business has grown, offering local methods of payment has become increasingly important for advertisers who want to buy Facebook Ads. Teaming with PayPal, a global leader in online payments, makes this possible.”</p>
<p>“Put simply, PayPal’s business is payments. We make it easier for customers to send and receive money online in 24 currencies and 190 markets around the world,” said Osama Bedier, PayPal’s vice president of platform and emerging technology. “We’ve always been an important part of the developer ecosystem on Facebook, and we’re excited to expand our relationship directly with Facebook to help grow advertisers’ and developers’ businesses.”</p>
<p><strong>About PayPal</strong></p>
<p>PayPal is the faster, safer way to pay and get paid online. The service allows members to send money without sharing financial information, with the flexibility to pay using their account balances, bank accounts, credit cards or promotional financing.

<p><strong>Service Gives Users New Tools to Control Their Information</strong></p>
<p>PALO ALTO, Calif. — December 9, 2009 —Setting a new standard in user control, Facebook announced today that it is calling on its more than 350 million users to review and update their privacy settings—a first among major Internet services. In addition, Facebook will be rolling out easy-to-use tools to empower people to personalize control over their information—based on what the content is, why they are sharing it, when, and the audience they seek to reach.</p>
<p>“Facebook is transforming the world’s ability to control its information online by empowering more than 350 million people to personalize the audience for each piece of content they share,” said Elliot Schrage, Vice President of Communications, Public Policy and Marketing. “We’ve always designed Facebook to enable people to control what information they share with whom—it’s the reason our service continues to attract such a broad and diverse group of users from around the world. We’re proud of the latest evolution we’re announcing today and we will continue to innovate to serve users’ changing needs.”</p>
<p>The tools launching today are part of Facebook’s continuing innovation and a response to requests from both users and experts. Different versions of these suggestions were developed and tested extensively since the beginning of this year. The resulting new features include added control for each piece of content users share, simplified privacy settings, help in choosing settings, and expanded privacy education materials.</p>
<p><strong>Adding Control For Each Item </strong></p>
<p>Users from all over the world have requested the ability to dynamically control who sees each individual piece of content. Facebook’s new Publisher Privacy Control—the main place to add content such as photos and status updates—provides this function and is rolling out to users today. This feature will enable people to easily select a privacy setting for every post they make at the time they create it. For example, a person may want to share some posts with everyone, such as her opinion on a new movie. Other times, that same person may want to share more personal updates like her new phone number or a photo of her children with a narrower community, such as her Friends or members of Friend Lists she has created. By making selections in a drop-down menu, users can easily tailor their posts to specified audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Simplified Privacy Settings </strong></p>
<p>Facebook’s current privacy model revolves around “networks”—communities for schools, companies or regions. However, some of the regional networks like Australia and Turkey now have millions of members, which is why Facebook is moving toward a more personalized model of control. Regional networks will be removed and replaced with four basic control settings—Friends, Friends of Friends, Everyone and Customized—that are simpler and apply uniformly to all users worldwide.</p>
<p>In addition, many users have expressed that the current set of privacy choices are confusing or overwhelming. In response, the Privacy Settings page has been completely redesigned with a goal of making the controls easy, intuitive and accessible. Based on user feedback, Facebook has consolidated some settings and grouped them in ways that are more logical and straightforward.</p>
<p><strong>Help In Choosing Settings </strong></p>
<p>Starting today, Facebook will also take the unprecedented step of presenting more than 350 million users with a Transition Tool—a transparent process requiring people to review and update their privacy settings. This tool will start with a message that explains the changes and will then let users update their settings. Users will be presented with two options: preserving their old settings or accepting recommendations from Facebook.</p>
<p>The recommendations are designed to help people connect and share—consistent with the reasons they joined Facebook—in a responsible way by taking into account how users have shared that information previously and recognizing that users may consider some information more sensitive. Potentially sensitive information, like phone numbers, is assigned a more restrictive recommendation. Facebook will suggest that users retain settings they have previously configured, but if users have not changed their settings in the past, Facebook’s recommendations will be pre-selected. Users can change any of the selections and they must confirm all selections before they take effect.</p>
<p>Once users have updated their settings, they will be shown a confirmation page that will let them review their selections again. The confirmation page also provides a link to the full Privacy Settings page where users can modify settings further as they see fit. Of course, users will be also able to change their settings whenever they want.</p>
<p><strong>Expanded Privacy Education </strong></p>
<p>As users move through the Transition Tool, they’ll be presented with an opportunity to “Learn More.” Through this link, they’ll reach Facebook’s new Privacy Center, a comprehensive guide that helps users understand and control how they share information. The Privacy Center explains Facebook’s principles of user control and related features. It also offers links to other privacy-related material on and off Facebook. Even after a user has completed the Transition Tool, the Privacy Center will always remain available from links throughout the site.</p>
<p>In addition to the Privacy Center, Facebook is paying special attention to educating new users. New users will be encouraged to learn more about privacy once they complete the registration process and will have the opportunity to view a New User Guide, which will include a section about privacy and link to the new Privacy Center. In addition, new users will also receive specific privacy education messages within important Facebook pages. Finally, the first time users seek to share content using the new Publisher Privacy Control, they will be shown a message that indicates who will see their post; it will also offer a link to additional information.</p>
<p>“One of our primary goals is to consistently improve Facebook and expand what our users can do through the site, and that includes providing them with new tools to help control their information,” said Chris Cox, Vice President of Product Management. “The features we’re announcing today aren’t the end point, but are simply the latest step in our iterative process. Great suggestions helped us get here, and we look forward to the feedback that will help us develop the next innovation in privacy and user control.”</p>
<p><strong>Additional Information </strong></p>
<p>No change or impact on advertising programs: Facebook has never shared personal information with advertisers except under the direction and control of a user. These new tools do not alter that policy or practice.</p>
<p>Common set of publicly available information: Facebook’s latest privacy policy, announced in October, indicated that certain basic information—a user’s name, profile picture, gender, current city, Friend List and Pages—would be categorized as “publicly available.” The overwhelming majority of users already make all of this information available to everyone and this label was chosen to ensure that users understand that it is possible for this information to be viewed by others. However, users can still avoid being found in searches or prevent contact from non-friends.</p>
<p>Special protections for minors: As part of the controls announced today, Facebook is limiting the visibility of content created by users under age 18. If a minor seeks to share information with “Everyone,” the widest circle of people who will actually be able see that content are his or her “Friends”, “Friends of Friends” and members of school or work networks he or she has joined.</p>

<p><strong>PALO ALTO, Calif. — August 10, 2009 —</strong> Facebook today announced that it has agreed to acquire FriendFeed, the innovative service for sharing online. As part of the agreement, all FriendFeed employees will join Facebook and FriendFeed’s four founders will hold senior roles on Facebook’s engineering and product teams.</p>
<p>“Facebook and FriendFeed share a common vision of giving people tools to share and connect with their friends,” said Bret Taylor, a FriendFeed co-founder and, previously, the group product manager who launched Google Maps. “We can’t wait to join the team and bring many of the innovations we’ve developed at FriendFeed to Facebook’s 250 million users around the world.” </p>
<p>“As we spent time with Mark and his leadership team, we were impressed by the open, creative culture they’ve built and their desire to have us contribute to it,” said Paul Buchheit, another FriendFeed co-founders. Buchheit, the Google engineer behind Gmail and the originator of Google’s “Don’t be evil” motto, added, “It was immediately obvious to us how passionate Facebook’s engineers are about creating simple, ground-breaking ways for people to share, and we are extremely excited to join such a like-minded group.”</p>
<p>Taylor and Buchheit founded FriendFeed along with Jim Norris and Sanjeev Singh in October 2007 after all four played key roles at Google for products like Gmail and Google Maps. At FriendFeed, they’ve brought together a world-class team of engineers and designers. </p>

<p>FriendFeed is based in Mountain View, Calif. and has 12 employees. FriendFeed.com will continue to operate normally for the time being as the teams determine the longer term plans for the product. </p>

<p><em>Passive Investment Includes Stake in Preferred Stock, Common Stock and Support for Facebook’s Continued Global Growth</em></p>
<p>PALO ALTO, Calif. — May 26, 2009 — Facebook today announced that Digital Sky Technologies (DST), one of the leading internet investment groups globally with significant stakes in Eastern European and Russian internet businesses, has made a $200 million investment in Facebook in exchange for preferred stock, representing a 1.96 percent equity stake at a $10 billion valuation. </p>
<p>In addition, DST has indicated that it is planning to offer to purchase at least $100 million of Facebook common stock from existing common stockholders that would facilitate liquidity for current and former employees’ vested shares in the company. The details of the plan are expected to be announced to eligible participants during the summer. Consistent with Facebook’s practice with other recent investors, DST will not be represented on the Facebook board or hold special observer rights.</p>
<p>“This investment demonstrates Facebook’s ongoing success at creating a global network for people to share and connect,” said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. “We’ve worked hard to bring more than 200 million people – 70 percent outside of the U.S. – onto Facebook to share with friends, family and co-workers. A number of firms approached us, but DST stood out because of the global perspective they bring – backed up by the impressive growth and financial achievements of their internet investments. We’re looking forward to working with the DST team.”</p>
<p>“Our investment experience in other regions reveals the tremendous value social networking companies create as they redefine how people communicate and interact,” said Yuri Milner, chief executive of DST. “By every important metric – user growth and engagement, technological innovation and financial performance – Facebook is on a similar trajectory, though on a much more global scale. We’re delighted to invest in Facebook, Mark and his management team as they make the world more open and connected.”</p>
<p>Based in London and Moscow, DST is a well-respected investor in a number of successful internet companies, holding significant interests in Russia and Eastern Europe, such as Mail.ru, Forticom and vKontakte. DST’s main assets account for over 70 percent of all page views in the Russian-speaking internet and its social networks are the market leaders in more than 13 countries, addressing a combined population of more than 350 million.</p>
<p>DST is run by its three partners who have complementary backgrounds in operations, investments and finance: Yuri Milner, previously CEO of Mail.ru, the #1 Russian language website; Gregory Finger, previously head of the Moscow office of NCH, a multi-billion dollar hedge fund; and Alexander Tamas, previously co-head of internet and software coverage in EMEA for the Investment Banking Division of Goldman Sachs. With its advanced understanding of opportunities in technology and social media, DST is a good fit for Facebook and an insightful partner that can help unlock additional growth opportunities.</p>

<p>PALO ALTO, Calif. — May 22, 2009 — Think Computer Corporation and Facebook® announced today that they have settled all outstanding claims, including all of Think’s claims related to Facebook’s registered trademarks. </p>
<p>On January 10, 2006, the USPTO issued U.S. Registration No. 3,041,791 to Facebook for the mark “FACEBOOK.” On July 25, 2006, the USPTO issued a second registration (No. 3,122,052) to Facebook. In April 2008, Think filed a petition to cancel the ‘052 registration. In March 2009, Think filed a petition to cancel the ‘791 registration. In the settlement, Think agrees to abandon its petitions to cancel the registrations.</p>
<p>Think’s CEO and founder, Aaron Greenspan, attended Harvard with Facebook CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg in 2002-2004, where both were entrepreneurially minded programmers. Starting in August 2003, Think released a web based student portal called houseSYSTEM through a Harvard student group. This software was designed to make life easier for students, faculty, and alumni. By September 2003, houseSYSTEM featured a section (devised and implemented by Greenspan) called “The Universal Face Book” (sometimes called “The Face Book”). </p>
<p>Think’s system contained a number of features, including a course scheduler, student marketplace, email service, automatic birthday reminder, message boards, photo album, digital flyer advertising, event calendar (with online RSVP’s), map integration, job placement, and local business reviews. At launch, houseSYSTEM did not feature member profiles due to campus security concerns. Profiles were added after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, along with new features, allowing friends to record the way they had met and noting the strength of their relationships.</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook, said “Aaron and I studied together at Harvard and I’ve always admired his entrepreneurial spirit and love of building things. I appreciate his hard work and innovation that led to building houseSYSTEM, including the Universal Face Book feature. At school, I was even a member of houseSYSTEM. We are pleased that we’ve been able to amicably resolve our differences.” </p>
<p>Aaron Greenspan, founder and CEO of Think, said “I am glad that my contributions have been recognized by Facebook. Mark has built a tremendous company at Facebook, and I wish them continued success in the future.”</p>

<p>• One-click login – users login with their Facebook identity and allow the Website to access their Facebook profile information</p>

<p>SAN MATEO, CA – December 2, 2008– Oodle announced today that it has been chosen to power Marketplace, an application for online classifieds on Facebook. Oodle was chosen because of its track record of innovation with online classifieds and will be developing an enhanced version of Marketplace scheduled for release in Q1 of 2009.</p>
<p>Facebook first introduced the Marketplace application in early May 2007 as a way for Facebook users to easily create, share and respond to listings across categories such as “Furniture” and “Roommates.” To further expand the functionality and breadth of the application, Facebook selected an outside developer with expertise in social networking and online classifieds. Oodle will develop and power Facebook’s Marketplace application, which will be integrated into the site similar to other third-party applications.</p>
<p>“In many cases, finding good homes for items we are no longer using is more important than selling them at the highest price,” said Craig Donato, CEO &amp; founder of Oodle. “For example, when I have extra tickets to a concert, I’d prefer to give them to a friend or sell them at face-value to someone I work with. We’re focused on making this simple to do with Marketplace.”</p>
<p>Everyone has things they no longer use that they should give away or sell. Posting to a traditional classifieds site involves meeting strangers, which can be uncomfortable. Emailing friends is inefficient and potentially annoying. Through Marketplace, members can easily buy and sell with people they know.</p>
<p>“Turning the development and management of Marketplace over to an innovator in online classifieds will give users more advanced ways to create and share listings on Facebook,” said Ethan Beard, director of business development at Facebook. “We’re excited by the potential of the Oodle powered Marketplace application to offer an engaging classifieds experience on Facebook.”</p>
<p>About Oodle</p>
<p>Oodle provides a better way to buy and sell through online classifieds. Buyers can see everything. Oodle aggregates over 500,000 new listings ever day from over 80,000 different sites. And sellers can post everywhere. Oodle syndicates listings, published by local sellers, across hundreds of sites in its partner network.</p>
<p>Oodle is the second largest online classifieds service in the US and attracts over six million unique visitors each month. Oodle’s partner network powers classifieds for over 200 leading brands, including Walmart, MySpace, and Cox Broadcasting. Oodle offers media companies, online communities and portals a proven business model and a great user experience for local community classifieds.</p>
<p>Oodle is also available in the United States (<a href=""http://www.oodle.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.oodle.com</a>), Canada (canada.oodle.com) &amp; UK(<a href=""http://www.oodle.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.oodle.co.uk</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Thoughts on Beacon</strong></p>
<p>About a month ago, we released a new feature called Beacon to try to help people share information with their friends about things they do on the web. We’ve made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but we’ve made even more with how we’ve handled them. We simply did a bad job with this release, and I apologize for it. While I am disappointed with our mistakes, we appreciate all the feedback we have received from our users. I’d like to discuss what we have learned and how we have improved Beacon.</p>
<p>When we first thought of Beacon, our goal was to build a simple product to let people share information across sites with their friends. It had to be lightweight so it wouldn’t get in people’s way as they browsed the web, but also clear enough so people would be able to easily control what they shared. We were excited about Beacon because we believe a lot of information people want to share isn’t on Facebook, and if we found the right balance, Beacon would give people an easy and controlled way to share more of that information with their friends.</p>
<p>But we missed the right balance. At first we tried to make it very lightweight so people wouldn’t have to touch it for it to work. The problem with our initial approach of making it an opt-out system instead of opt-in was that if someone forgot to decline to share something, Beacon still went ahead and shared it with their friends. It took us too long after people started contacting us to change the product so that users had to explicitly approve what they wanted to share. Instead of acting quickly, we took too long to decide on the right solution. I’m not proud of the way we’ve handled this situation and I know we can do better.</p>
<p>Facebook has succeeded so far in part because it gives people control over what and how they share information. This is what makes Facebook a good utility, and in order to be a good feature, Beacon also needs to do the same. People need to be able to explicitly choose what they share, and they need to be able to turn Beacon off completely if they don’t want to use it.</p>
<p>This has been the philosophy behind our recent changes. Last week we changed Beacon to be an opt-in system, and today we’re releasing a privacy control to turn off Beacon completely. You can find it here. If you select that you don’t want to share some Beacon actions or if you turn off Beacon, then Facebook won’t store those actions even when partners send them to Facebook.</p>
<p>On behalf of everyone working at Facebook, I want to thank you for your feedback on Beacon over the past several weeks and hope that this new privacy control addresses any remaining issues we’ve heard about from you.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read this.</p>
<p>Mark</p>

<p>NEW YORK — Facebook Social Advertising Event, Nov. 6, 2007 — Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg today introduced Facebook Ads, an ad system for businesses to connect with users and target advertising to the exact audiences they want. Through Facebook Ads, these users can now learn about new businesses, brands and products through the trusted referrals of their friends.</p>
<p>“Facebook Ads represent a completely new way of advertising online,” Zuckerberg told an audience of more than 250 marketing and advertising executives in New York. “For the last hundred years media has been pushed out to people, but now marketers are going to be a part of the conversation. And they’re going to do this by using the social graph in the same way our users do.”</p>
<p>The keynote opened the Facebook Social Advertising event, which also featured senior executives from landmark partners including Blockbuster, CBS, Chase, The Coca-Cola Company, Microsoft, Sony Pictures Television and Verizon Wireless. More than 60 major consumer and Internet brand partners were highlighted at the launch of Facebook Ads. </p>
<p>Today, Facebook Ads launched with three parts: a way for businesses to build pages on Facebook to connect with their audiences; an ad system that facilitates the spread of brand messages virally through Facebook Social Ads™; and an interface to gather insights into people’s activity on Facebook that marketers care about.</p>
<p>More than 100,000 Facebook Pages Launch Today Zuckerberg detailed how Facebook Pages allows users to interact and affiliate with businesses and organizations in the same way they interact with other Facebook user profiles. More than 100,000 new Facebook Pages launched today covering the world’s largest brands, local businesses, organizations and bands.</p>
<p>“The core of every user’s experience on Facebook is their page and that’s where businesses are going to start as well,” explained Zuckerberg. “The first thing businesses can do is design a page to craft the exact experience they want people to see.”</p>
<p>Just like a Facebook user, businesses can start with a blank canvas and add all the information and content they want, including photos, videos, music and Facebook Platform applications. Outside developers have created a range of applications to enhance Facebook Pages, such as booking reservations or providing reviews of restaurant pages, buying tickets on a movie page or creating a custom t-shirt. Companies launching applications for Pages include Fandango, iLike, Musictoday LLC, OpenTable, SeamlessWeb, Zagat Survey LLC and Zazzle.</p>
<p>Distribution through the Social Graph Advertising messages will gain distribution through what Facebook has termed the “social graph,” the network of real connections through which people communicate and share information. When people engage with a business’ Facebook Page, that action will spread information about that business through the social graph. </p>
<p>Users can become a fan of a business and can share information about that business with their friends and act as a trusted referral. Facebook users can interact directly with the business through its Facebook Page by adding reviews, writing on that business’ Wall, uploading photos and in any other ways that a business may want to enable. These actions could appear in users’ Mini-Feed and News Feed, Facebook’s popular products that allow users to share information more efficiently with their friends.</p>
<p>Unique Ads with Social Actions “Social actions are powerful because they act as trusted referrals and reinforce the fact that people influence people,” said Zuckerberg. “It’s no longer just about messages that are broadcasted out by companies, but increasingly about information that is shared between friends. So we set out to use these social actions to build a new kind of ad system.”</p>
<p>Facebook’s ad system serves Social Ads that combine social actions from your friends – such as a purchase of a product or review of a restaurant – with an advertiser’s message. This enables advertisers to deliver more tailored and relevant ads to Facebook users that now include information from their friends so they can make more informed decisions. No personally identifiable information is shared with an advertiser in creating a Social Ad.</p>
<p>Social Ads can appear either within a user’s News Feed as sponsored content or in the ad space along the left side of the site. </p>
<p>Insights about Brand Presence and Promotion Facebook gives marketers valuable metrics about their presence and promotion on Facebook. Facebook Insights gives access to data on activity, fan demographics, ad performance and trends that better equip marketers to improve custom content on Facebook and adjust ad targeting. Facebook Insights is a free service for all Facebook Pages and Social Ads.</p>
<p>Protecting User’s Privacy Facebook has always empowered users to make choices about sharing their data, and with Facebook Ads we are extending that to marketing messages that appear on the site. Facebook users will only see Social Ads to the extent their friends are sharing information with them.</p>

<p>NEW YORK — Facebook Social Advertising Event, Nov. 6, 2007 — Facebook announced today that 44 websites are using Facebook Beacon to allow users to share information from other websites for distribution to their friends on Facebook. These sites are participating in the launch of Beacon, a new way to socially distribute information on Facebook. Beacon is a core element of the Facebook Ads system for connecting businesses with users and targeting advertising to the audiences they want.</p>
<p>The websites participating in Beacon can determine the most relevant and appropriate set of actions from their sites that users can distribute on Facebook. These actions can include posting an item for sale, completing a purchase, scoring a high score in an online game or viewing of video. When users who are logged into Facebook visit a participating site, they receive a prompt asking whether to they want to share those activities with their friends on Facebook. If they do, those friends can now view those actions through News Feed or Mini-Feed stories. </p>
<p>eBay plans to use Beacon so eBay.com sellers will be able to choose to include their eBay listings in their Facebook News Feeds. This will allow them to share the items they are selling with their network of friends. In doing so, eBay.com sellers can leverage a new way to drive potential bidders and buyers to their listings. eBay expects to make this feature available to sellers on eBay.com in early 2008.</p>
<p> “Beacon offers an interesting new way for us to deliver on our goal of bringing more bidders and buyers to our sellers’ listings,” said Gary Briggs, senior vice president and chief marketing officer, eBay North America. “In a marketplace where trust and reputation are crucial to success, giving sellers the ability to easily alert their network of friends – the people who already know and trust them – to an item for sale has the potential to be a powerful tool.” </p>
<p>In keeping with Facebook’s philosophy of user control, Facebook Beacon provides advanced privacy controls so Facebook users can decide whether to distribute specific actions from participating sites with their friends. </p>
<p>Fandango, the nation’s leading moviegoer destination, is using Beacon so when Facebook users purchase a movie ticket on Fandango.com, they can share their movie plans with their friends on Facebook. Consumers gain a new way to tell their friends about their movie tastes, while Fandango is able to gain greater social distribution on Facebook. </p>
<p> “People love to share movies with their friends,” said Chuck Davis, CEO of Fandango. “When it comes to movies, everyone has an opinion. Fandango is excited to be selected as one of the first sites to implement Beacon, allowing Facebook users to share the excitement of moviegoing with their friends.”</p>
<p>A number of IAC brands, including CollegeHumor, Busted Tees, iWon, Citysearch, Pronto.com and echomusic will also be using Facebook Beacon to share actions taken on participating IAC sites from concert tickets to restaurant reviews with friends online. The sheer diversity and scale of IAC brands has the potential to enable Facebook friends to share the more interesting parts of their life online.</p>
<p>“IAC brands touch consumers in a multitude of different ways everyday. Bringing together great consumer services and products and the added ability to share individual actions with friends via Facebook can only add value to what we do and who we do it for,” said Doug Lebda, president and chief operating officer of IAC.</p>
<p>As a way to let travelers tell their Facebook friends about upcoming travel plans, Travelocity is implementing Facebook Beacon on its website. When Facebook users book travel on Travelocity, they can choose to share that information with their friends on Facebook. </p>
<p>“Travel is naturally a social activity that travelers enjoy discussing with the people they know,” said Jeff Glueck, chief marketing officer at Travelocity. “Using Beacon, Travelocity users can now easily choose to spread the news of their latest vacation plans on Facebook as a complement to their activities on the Travelocity website.” </p>
<p>Additional websites and companies participating in Beacon at launch include AllPosters.com, Blockbuster, Bluefly.com, CBS Interactive (CBSSports.com &amp; Dotspotter), ExpoTV, Gamefly, Hotwire, Joost, Kiva, Kongregate, LiveJournal, Live Nation, Mercantila, National Basketball Association, NYTimes.com, Overstock.com, (RED), Redlight, SeamlessWeb, Sony Online Entertainment LLC, Sony Pictures, STA Travel, The Knot, TripAdvisor, Travel Ticker, TypePad, viagogo, Vox, Yelp, WeddingChannel.com and Zappos.com.</p>

<p>NEW YORK — Facebook Social Advertising Event, Nov. 6, 2007 — Facebook today announced that 12 of the world’s largest brands and companies have immediately committed to using Facebook Ads, an ad system that enables people to provide trusted referrals to their friends and helps businesses to spread information through the social graph and communicate with their customers in completely new ways. </p>
<p>With Facebook Ads, users can learn about brands and businesses through trusted referrals from their friends on Facebook. Advertisers can connect with users by creating a presence on Facebook and targeting the exact people they want. </p>
<p>Facebook Ads includes three parts: a way for businesses to build pages on Facebook to connect with its audience; an ad system that facilitates the spread of brand messages virally through Facebook Social Ads™; and an interface to gather insights into people’s activity on Facebook that marketers care about. On other websites, Facebook Beacon provides a way for users to choose to share their activities with their friends on Facebook. Landmark partners are implementing the fullest set of offerings from Facebook Ads.</p>
<p> “We have consistently explored new ways to reach our target audience with a compelling brand experience,” said Carol Kruse, vice president, global interactive marketing, The Coca-Cola Company. “With Facebook Ads, our brands can become a part of the way users communicate and interact on Facebook.”</p>
<p>The Coca-Cola Company will feature its Sprite brand on a new Facebook Page and will invite users to add an application to their account called “Sprite Sips.” People will be able to create, configure and interact with an animated Sprite Sips character. For consumers in the United States, the experience can be enhanced by entering a PIN code found under the cap of every 20 oz. bottle of Sprite to unlock special features and accessories. The Sprite Sips character provides a means for interacting with friends on Facebook. In addition, Sprite will create a new Facebook Page for Sprite Sips and will run a series of Social Ads that leverage Facebook’s natural viral communications to spread the application across its user base. </p>
<p>As part of a wide-ranging effort to engage Facebook users in a community-driven movie-focused movie experience, Blockbuster has implemented Facebook Beacon on blockbuster.com that allows Facebook users to share the titles of the movies they add to their queue on Blockbuster’s website back to their friends on the Facebook website. </p>
<p>Blockbuster has also built a Facebook application – Movie Clique – that, once installed, enables Facebook users to search thousands of movie titles, create lists of movies they want to see and share movie ratings and reviews while staying updated on new movie releases and promotions. Facebook users who are subscribers to Blockbuster’s online rental service get the added benefit of using Movie Clique to rent movies directly from Blockbuster within the Facebook website. Additionally, through Social Ads, Blockbuster will be able to further promote relevant actions from both its application and Beacon to users’ friends.</p>
<p>“We view this as an innovative way to cultivate relationships with millions of Facebook users by enabling them to interact with Blockbuster in convenient, relevant and entertaining ways,” said Jim Keyes, Blockbuster chairman and CEO. “This is beyond creating advertising impressions. This is about Blockbuster participating in the community of the consumer so that, in return, consumers feel motivated to share the benefits of our brand with their friends.” </p>
<p>For Verizon, Facebook Ads has provided a way to not only enhance its presence on the website with a Facebook Page, but also as a way to create fun and useful applications featuring ringtones and text messaging. A ringtone application allows users to match ringtones with the personalities of their friends, while Verizon Text A Friend enables users to send text messages, to those that accept them, from Facebook to friends’ mobile devices. Both applications, built on Facebook’s Platform, are available on the Verizon Page and can be added by users to their Facebook accounts.</p>
<p>“We’re always looking for new ideas and fresh ways to engage with our customers, and Facebook is providing tremendous thought leadership on this front,” said John Harrobin, senior vice president, marketing and digital media, Verizon.</p>
<p>Partners joining the stage at a launch event in New York for Facebook Ads included senior executives from Blockbuster, CBS, Chase, The Coca-Cola Company, Sony Pictures and Verizon. Other brands and companies launching with Facebook Ads include CondéNet (Epicurious.com and flip.com), Crest Whitestrips, Dove Cream Oils®, Herbal Essences, The New York Times Co., and Saturn. </p>

<p>Thank you Attorney General Cuomo and to the State of New York for hosting Facebook here today.</p>
<p>As a native New Yorker, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had hoped to join us today. He asked that I represent the company today as we work with Attorney General Cuomo to enhance our efforts to make Facebook a trusted online environment for all users.</p>
<p>When Mark and his co-founders built the Facebook website in 2004, privacy was a core tenet. This was evident early on by the segmented structure of networks and extensive privacy options. Today, with over 47 million active users, we at Facebook are committed to the principles from our founding days.</p>
<p>We have worked closely with the Attorney General over the last several weeks with a renewed vigilance to empower people to be safe on Facebook. We care deeply about Facebook users. Today, we pledge a solution.</p>
<p>In addition to the terms of the agreement laid out by Attorney General Cuomo, Facebook will continue to develop sophisticated safety technology and offer users extensive privacy controls so they can make their information available only to the people they choose.</p>
<p>We will welcome the Independent Safety and Security Examiner to work closely with me and the other members of our Privacy and Safety team, including former Indiana Attorney General Jeff Modisett, and former Federal Trade Commissioner Mozelle Thompson.</p>
<p>We live in an age in which communication is transforming. More people share information online than ever before. Privacy and safety are a core part of helping individuals share information with the people who matter to them most. Society must educate its youth about safe practices on the Internet and empower its children to act responsibly.</p>
<p>Attorney General Cuomo has taken a leadership role in this charge. We are proud to join him today to define and lead technology industry standards for online safety. We will also continue our longstanding work with him and the other attorneys general through the 50-state task force on Internet Safety to extend and improve key standards for online safety.</p>
<p>Facebook is committed to leadership in offering its users a trusted online environment.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p><strong>PALO ALTO, Calif. — Sept. 26, 2006 —</strong> Facebook, the Internet’s leading social utility, today announced that it has expanded to enable everyone to connect with their friends and the people around them. People can now join one of more than 500 regional networks to share information with other people on Facebook and take advantage of the site’s industry-leading privacy controls.</p>
<p>Previously, a supported “.edu,” “.com,” “.org,” “.gov” or “.mil” email address was needed to register on Facebook. While prior expansions enabled more people from schools, companies, non-profits, and government entities to register for Facebook, this latest expansion makes it possible for anyone with a valid email address to join Facebook and interact with their friends and people in their region. New users are still required to prove affiliation to access an existing college or work network, and are also asked to validate their mobile phone number to verify their account.</p>
<p>“We are expanding to respond to the requests of millions of people who want to be part of Facebook, but haven’t been able to until today,” said Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO, Facebook. “About one-third of Facebook’s college users have already graduated and are now interacting with more people outside of their schools and work environment.”</p>
<p>Consistent with Facebook’s unique network structure, people’s profiles are only accessible to other people in the same network and to confirmed friends. Facebook has launched additional privacy controls with this expansion that allow every user to: • Block other users in specific networks from searching for his or her name. • Prevent people in those networks from messaging, poking and adding him or her as a friend. • Control whether his or her profile picture shows up in search results.</p>

<p><strong>PALO ALTO, Calif. — Sept. 8, 2006 —</strong> Facebook, the Internet’s leading social utility, today announced additional controls for News Feed and Mini-Feed in response to user feedback and to reaffirm its commitment to industry-leading privacy practices. “The recent outpouring of feedback, both positive and negative, confirms the passion people feel for Facebook and its importance in their lives,” said Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO, Facebook. “We think News Feed and Mini-Feed offer something people can’t find anywhere else on the Internet. These additional privacy features put control of who sees what information in News Feed and Mini-Feed directly into the hands of our users, just as they requested.” Facebook has developed an additional privacy page that gives users granular control of how information is integrated into News Feed and Mini-Feed. The company will continue to incorporate user feedback into its development process. The new privacy page includes individual settings to block information on News Feed and Mini- Feed, including when a user: removes profile information, posts on a Wall, comments on a Note or photo, posts on a discussion board, adds a friend, removes relationship status, or leaves a group or a network.

<p><strong>PALO ALTO, Calif., and REDMOND, Wash. — Aug. 22, 2006 —</strong> Facebook and Microsoft Corp. today announced a strategic alliance in which the two companies will collaborate to bring relevant advertising to the more than nine million registered users of Facebook, the Internet’s leading social utility. Microsoft’s advanced advertising technology and Facebook’s unique social network make possible the multi-year collaboration grounded in the two companies’ commitment to technological innovation. As part of the relationship, Microsoft will be the exclusive provider of banner advertising and sponsored links on Facebook using Microsoft’s digital advertising solutions and the Microsoft® adCenter platform. The two companies also agreed to work together on future technology and advertising initiatives. “Our collaboration with Facebook is about joining our cutting-edge advertising technology and sales force with a true innovator in social networking,” said Steve Berkowitz, senior vice president of the Online Services Group at Microsoft. “We believe that the combination of Microsoft and Facebook strengths will be incredibly attractive to advertisers as they forge more meaningful connections with one of the largest, most engaged audiences on the Internet. The consumer assets brought to bear by this relationship will be very hard to match.” Advanced technology from Microsoft and Facebook will help connect advertisers with Facebook users in more relevant, innovative ways through a combination of graphical ad placements, as well as automated text-based advertisements targeted to content and, over time, aggregate user behavior on an anonymous basis. “We’re excited to be innovating with Microsoft to build a world-class advertising solution that allows Facebook to deliver the best advertising experience in social media,” said Owen Van Natta, chief operating officer at Facebook. “We chose Microsoft because it, like Facebook, is a technology company at its core and is committed to taking a fresh approach to targeting advertising to social media. We’re committed to providing a great user and advertiser experience together.”</p>
<p>The two companies began talks about the relationship only last week and expect the new advertising experiences to appear in the early fall. Microsoft and Facebook have expressed an interest in moving quickly to implement the terms of the deal. <strong>About Microsoft </strong> Founded in 1975, Microsoft (Nasdaq: “MSFT”) is the worldwide leader in software, services and solutions that help people and businesses realize their full potential. </p>

<p><strong>PALO ALTO, Calif. — May 3, 2006 —</strong> Facebook, the social directory that enables people to share information, announced today that it now supports more than 1,000 work networks. Alumni are now able to register for Facebook with authenticated “.com” or “.org” email addresses. College and high school students can continue to register for the site using their “.edu” email addresses to authenticate their identity and affiliation with their school. “The number one request we receive from people is to have the ability to invite friends outside their college network,” said Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO, Facebook. “We’re committed to growing with our alumni and increasing the site’s utility and availability to them as they leave college.” One-third of college students on Facebook will have graduated and headed into the workforce by completion of the 2006 academic year. Forty-five percent of Facebook’s college alumni currently come back to the site every day. Facebook’s work networks will allow them to connect with the people around them. Alumni can join their work network from their existing accounts and then invite co-workers to join.

<p><strong>PALO ALTO, CA – April 19, 2006 –</strong> Facebook, the Internet’s leading social utility, announced today that it has secured $25 million in funding. Greylock Partners led the financing while Meritech Capital Partners and Facebook’s existing investors Accel Partners and Peter Thiel also participated. Facebook’s website has grown to more than seven million people and, according to comScore, ranks as the seventh most trafficked site on the web. Facebook will use the funding to develop new features to enable people to easily share information in a trusted environment. People with a valid email address from a supported college or high school can register for Facebook and create a profile to share information, photos, and interests with their friends. “We’re building this company for the long term and this funding validates the viability of our business,” said Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO, Facebook. “We’re still in the early stages of building Facebook. We’re constantly developing new functionality to make Facebook more useful and this funding will help accelerate our development efforts.” The most recent development was the launch of Facebook’s mobile functionality, which allows people to search for friends and get their contact information, message them, Poke them, and wall post to their Facebook profile. Facebook Mobile currently uses SMS technology so no browser or Internet connection is required. “Facebook has become an essential part of daily life and an important brand for an influential, hard-to-reach demographic,” said David Sze, General Partner, Greylock Partners. “We’re excited about the value Facebook is creating for users and advertisers.”</p>
<p>Facebook was built to make it easy for people to share information with their friends in a trusted environment.

Two-thirds of registered people on Facebook come back to the site daily and, according to comScore, spend an average of 20 minutes a day sharing and gathering information. Since the beginning, Facebook has led the industry in delivering tools that allow people to control the information they share and with whom they choose to share it. Matters of privacy have been a top priority for Facebook, resulting in hiring a Chief Privacy Officer in September 2005. Facebook believes in protecting users’ privacy and has participated with such organizations as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, International Association of Privacy Professionals, and WiredSafety.</p>
