<p>We are working to tackle vaccine misinformation on Facebook by reducing its distribution and providing people with authoritative information on the topic. We are starting by taking a series of steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will reduce the ranking of groups and Pages that spread misinformation about vaccinations in News Feed and Search. These groups and Pages will not be included in recommendations or in predictions when you type into Search.</li>
<li>When we find ads that include misinformation about vaccinations, we will reject them. We also removed related targeting options, like “vaccine controversies.” For ad accounts that continue to violate our policies, we may take further action, such as disabling the ad account.</li>
<li>We won’t show or recommend content that contains misinformation about vaccinations on Instagram Explore or hashtag pages.</li>
<li>We are exploring ways to share educational information about vaccines when people come across misinformation on this topic.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>How This Will Work</b></p>
<p>Leading global health organizations, such as the World Health Organization and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have publicly identified verifiable vaccine hoaxes. If these vaccine hoaxes appear on Facebook, we will take action against them.</p>
<p>For example, if a group or Page admin posts this vaccine misinformation, we will exclude the entire group or Page from recommendations, reduce these groups and Pages’ distribution in News Feed and Search, and reject ads with this misinformation.</p>
<p>We also believe in providing people with additional context so they can decide whether to read, share, or engage in conversations about information they see on Facebook. We are exploring ways to give people more accurate information from expert organizations about vaccines at the top of results for related searches, on Pages discussing the topic, and on invitations to join groups about the topic. We will have an update on this soon.</p>
<p>We are fully committed to the safety of our community and will continue to expand on this work.</p>

<p><i>By Nathaniel Gleicher, Head of Cybersecurity Policy</i></p>
<p>Today we removed multiple Pages, groups and accounts that engaged in coordinated inauthentic behavior on Facebook and Instagram. The two domestic operations we found originated in the UK and Romania. We didn’t find any links between these sets of activities, but they used similar tactics by creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing.</p>
<p>We are constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don’t want our services to be used to manipulate people. We’re taking down these Pages and accounts based on their behavior, not the content they posted. In each of these cases, the people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, and that was the basis for our action.</p>
<p>While we are making progress rooting out this abuse, as we’ve said before, it’s an ongoing challenge because the people responsible are determined and well funded. We constantly have to improve to stay ahead. That means building better technology, hiring more people and working more closely with law enforcement, security experts and other companies. Their collaboration was critical to these investigations.</p>
<p>We’ll update this post with more details when we have them, or if the facts change.</p>
<p><b>What We’ve Found So Far</b></p>
<p><b>Today we removed 137 Facebook and Instagram accounts, Pages and Groups for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior as part of a domestic-focused network in the UK.</b> The individuals behind these accounts represented themselves as far-right and anti-far-right activists, frequently changed Page and Group names, and operated fake accounts to engage in hate speech and spread divisive comments on both sides of the political debate in the UK. Despite their misrepresentation of their identities, we found that these Pages, Groups and accounts were connected. They frequently posted about local and political news including topics like immigration, free speech, racism, LGBT issues, far-right politics, issues between India and Pakistan, and religious beliefs including Islam and Christianity.</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Presence on Facebook and Instagram:</i> 23 Pages, 74 Facebook accounts, 5 Groups, and 35 Instagram accounts.</li>
<li><i>Followers:</i><i> </i>About 175,000 accounts followed one or more of these Pages, and around 4,500 accounts followed one or more of these Instagram accounts.</li>
<li><i>Advertising:</i> Around $1,500 in spending for ads on Facebook paid for in US dollars and GB pounds. The first ad ran in December 2013, and the most recent ad ran in October 2018. We have not completed a review of the organic content coming from these accounts.</li>
</ul>
<p>We identified these accounts and Pages through an internal investigation into UK-linked coordinated inauthentic behavior. Our assessment benefited from reporting by UK law enforcement. We have shared information about our analysis back with law enforcement, policymakers in the UK, and our industry partners.</p>

<p><b>Separately, we also removed 31 Facebook Pages, Groups, and accounts for engaging in coordinated inauthentic behavior as part of a network that operated in Romania and used a combination of fake accounts and some authentic accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing. </b>The Page admins and account owners typically posted about local news and political issues, including partisan news under fictitious bylines in support of the Social Democratic Party (PSD). They also shared divisive narratives and promoted content hosted by several domains that present themselves as news sites. Although the people behind this activity attempted to conceal their identities, our manual review found that some of this activity was linked to an individual associated with the PSD.</p>

<p>Today, Mark Zuckerberg outlined Facebook’s vision and principles around building a privacy-focused messaging and social networking platform:</p>
<ul>
<li class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa""><strong>Private interactions</strong>. People should have simple, intimate places where they have clear control over who can communicate with them and confidence that no one else can access what they share.</li>
<li class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa""><strong>Encryption</strong>. People’s private communications should be secure. End-to-end encryption prevents anyone — including us — from seeing what people share on our services.</li>
<li class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa""><strong>Reducing Permanence</strong>. People should be comfortable being themselves, and should not have to worry about what they share coming back to hurt them later. So we won’t keep messages or stories around for longer than necessary to deliver the service or longer than people want them.</li>
<li class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa""><strong>Safety</strong>. People should expect that we will do everything we can to keep them safe on our services within the limits of what’s possible in an encrypted service.</li>
<li class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa""><strong>Interoperability</strong>. People should be able to use any of our apps to reach their friends, and they should be able to communicate across networks easily and securely.</li>
<li class=""_2cuy _3dgx _2vxa""><strong>Secure data storage</strong>. People should expect that we won’t store sensitive data in countries with weak records on human rights like privacy and freedom of expression in order to protect data from being improperly accessed.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re committed to working openly and consulting with experts across society as we develop this. You can read Mark’s full note below.</p>

3,"March 4, 2019","<div class=""post-content"">
<p><i>By Clair Deevy, Director of Community Affairs, Asia Pacific</i></p>
<p>Today we’re launching <a href=""https://wethinkdigital.fb.com/"">We Think Digital</a>, an online education portal with interactive tutorials aimed at helping people think critically and share thoughtfully online. We designed the program in partnership with experts from across Asia Pacific, and aim to train 1 million people across 8 countries in Asia Pacific by 2020, with our resources available in 6 different languages.</p>
<p>Asia Pacific has a fast-growing internet population, with more than 2.21 billion people now online and 203 million new people joining in the past year, according to We Are Social’s 2019 <a href=""https://wearesocial.com/global-digital-report-2019"">Digital Trends Report</a>. We Think Digital has been designed for new and existing internet users of all ages to develop the skills they need to safely enjoy digital technology, including critical thinking and empathy.</p>
<p>We’ve developed a series of online tutorials in collaboration with journalist Saffron Howden and with support from TJ Agulto from AHA Behavioral Design; Associate Professor Michael Dezuanni from the Queensland University of Technology; Professor Katherine Chen from National Chengchi University; Chairman Wayne Chau of the Agent of Change Foundation; Executive Director Hamish Curry of the Asia Education Foundation; and Dr Damien Spry, Lecturer of Media &amp; Communications at the University of South Australia and Visiting Fellow at Queensland University of Technology’s Digital Media Research Centre. These academics and representatives from NGOs and civil society organizations across the region all came together to address the question: what does it mean to be a Digital Citizen?</p>
<p>The topics covered include privacy, safety, security, digital discourse and knowing your digital footprint. The four modules are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>What Is the Internet?</b> An explanation of the internet and social media, how they work, and the importance of digital citizenship.</li>
<li><b>Your Digital Footprint</b>: All you need to know about safety and security online and managing your digital footprint.</li>
<li><b>Be a Critical Thinker</b>: Helping you to discern different types of information and develop critical thinking and empathy when communicating online.</li>
<li><b>You as a Digital Citizen:</b> Insights into digital discourse and the differences between interacting online versus offline, your rights and responsibilities, as well as internet concepts like netiquette, being a creator, copyright and plagiarism.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’re launching this program in Singapore first, before rolling it out to the Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia, Vietnam, Taiwan. We also plan to bring this program beyond Asia Pacific to Argentina and Mexico. In Singapore, the program is supported by <a href=""https://www.pa.gov.sg/"">The People’s Association</a>, an organization which works to bring Singaporeans from all walks of life together through community programs. We are also forming a regional Steering Committee, whose role will be to advise Facebook on how to ensure We Think Digital can bring the most value to communities across Asia Pacific. The committee will comprise members from around the region, and its first two members are Dr. Vu Minh Khuong, Associate Professor at Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, National University of Singapore, and Dr. Pijitra Tsukamoto, Associate Professor at Thailand’s Chulalongkorn University.</p>
<p><b>Mr Chia Tze Yee, the People’s Association’s Group Director, Engagement Group said: </b>“Improving digital literacy and encouraging greater levels of digital citizenship benefits everyone in an increasingly connected community. The People’s Association recognizes the need to equip residents, especially seniors, with digital citizenship skills to exercise critical thinking and responsible online behaviour. We are happy to partner with Facebook to launch the We Think Digital initiative and are proud to be able to use our own ‘Seniors for Smart Nation’ programs and Silver Infocomm Wellness Ambassadors to help deliver these valuable skills to the public.”</p>

<p><i>By Katie Harbath, Public Policy Director, Global Elections and Ruben Hattari, Head of Public Policy, Indonesia</i></p>
<p>At Facebook, we’re focused on protecting elections while also making sure people have a voice in the political process. Over the last two years, we’ve learned from elections around the world to create a robust approach to safeguard our platform. This includes removing fake accounts, reducing false news, disrupting bad actors and increasing ads transparency. And we’re doing this while also supporting an informed and engaged electorate.</p>
<p>Today, we’re sharing more details on how we will protect the Indonesian elections in April.</p>
<p><b>Restricting Foreign Electoral Ads</b></p>
<p>Combating foreign interference is a key pillar of our approach to safeguarding election integrity on our platform. As part of this commitment, we’re temporarily disallowing electoral ads purchased from outside Indonesia ahead of the election. The restriction took effect this morning and will apply to any ad coming from an advertiser based outside of the country, if it references politicians or political parties or attempts to encourage or suppress voting.</p>
<p>We are using a mix of automated and human review to help us identify foreign electoral ads that should no longer be running on our platform.</p>
<p><b>Greater Transparency for All Ads</b></p>
<p>As part of our commitment to support an informed electorate, we’ve taken steps to provide more information about any ad a Page is running in the Page’s <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/transparency-for-ads-and-pages/"">“Info and Ads” section</a>. This includes electoral ads. People can also report an ad by tapping the three dots in the top right corner and selecting “Report Ad.” This section also offers more information about a Page, like when it was created and its previous names. This gives people a better understanding of the Page’s original purpose.</p>
<p>We’re also rolling out <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/01/elections-2019/"">a set of global political advertising tools by the end of June</a><a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2019/01/elections-2019/"">.</a> With each election, we’re learning which tools are most useful, so we can bring them to more countries, faster.</p>
<p><b>More Resources for Rapid Response </b></p>
<p>We are committed to tackling all kinds of inauthentic behavior and abuse on our platform — which we know often intensify during elections — from misinformation, misrepresentation and foreign interference, to phishing, harassment and violent threats. Our security team is working around the clock to help us stay a step ahead and uncover abuse. Globally, we’ve removed thousands of Pages, groups and accounts that engaged in <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/inside-feed-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/"">coordinated inauthentic behavior</a> across our platforms. We are committed to making improvements and building stronger partnerships around the world to more effectively detect and stop this activity.</p>
<p>We’re also setting up an operations center in Singapore focused on election integrity ahead of key elections across Asia-Pacific. The center will be staffed by experts from Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, who will work cross-functionally with our threat intelligence, data science, engineering, research, community operations, legal and other teams. This center will work with our Menlo Park headquarters and in-country experts to serve as another line of defense against false news and misinformation, hate speech, voter suppression and election interference.</p>
<p>Our teams also work closely with lawmakers, election commissions, fact-checkers, researchers, academics and civil society groups to better integrate efforts on important issues related to election integrity.</p>
<p><b>Growing Our Capacity to Address Misinformation and False News</b></p>
<p>We also want to make sure people see accurate information about the upcoming election and the choices they’ll be making at the ballot box. That’s why we’ve taken steps — in Indonesia and around the world — to improve the quality and authenticity of information on our platform and fight false news. We do this in three main ways:</p>
<p>First, we remove content that violates our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards"">Community Standards</a>, which help enforce the safety and security of the platform. Then, for content that does not directly break our rules, but still undermines the authenticity of the platform — like clickbait or sensational material — we <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/05/inside-feed-reduce-remove-inform/"">reduce its distribution</a> in News Feed so less people see it. Finally, we inform people by giving them more context on the information they see. For instance, when someone comes across a story, they can tap on “<a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/inside-feed-article-context/"">About this article</a>” to see more details on the article and the publisher.</p>
<p>We also want to empower people to decide for themselves what to read, trust and share. In Indonesia, we’re conducting the Think Before You Share school program in partnership with YCAB Foundation and Do Something Indonesia. Our goal is to educate more than 30,000 students, teachers and parents in seven provinces about critical thinking skills in the online world.</p>
<p>And through our Laju Digital program in East Indonesia, we’re training local government officials and community members in key digital skills.</p>
<p><b>Increasing our Safety and Security Efforts</b></p>
<p>We now have more than 30,000 people working on safety and security across the company, three times as many as we had in 2017. We have also improved our machine learning capabilities, which allows us to be more efficient and effective in finding and removing violating behavior. These improvements have helped in many ways, especially in our work to fight <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/inside-feed-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/"">coordinated inauthentic behavior,</a> where we’ve used a mix of technology and our expert investigators to search for and take down more sophisticated networks.</p>
<p>While these efforts are global, we also customize our work to individual countries based on research and threat assessments that begin many months before ballots are cast. This means we have safety and security teams working to identify and disrupt any information operations we find, including in Indonesia. We’re also providing safety and security guidance to help protect candidates and party Pages from hacking and impersonation. Like we do for all elections, we will be proactively monitoring for impersonation or hacked accounts.</p>
<p>We want to make it harder to interfere with elections on the platform, and easier for people to make their voices legitimately heard in the political process. We have dedicated teams working on every upcoming election around the world, including Indonesia.

<p><em>By Paul Grewal, Vice President and Deputy General Counsel, Litigation</em></p>
<p>Today, Facebook and Instagram filed a lawsuit in US federal court against four companies and three people based in the People’s Republic of China for promoting the sale of fake accounts, likes and followers. They did this on both Facebook and Instagram as well as other online service providers including Amazon, Apple, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter. We’re also enforcing our rights under US intellectual property law for their illegal use of our trademarks and brand.</p>
<p>By filing the lawsuit, we hope to reinforce that this kind of fraudulent activity is not tolerated – and that we’ll act forcefully to protect the integrity of our platform.</p>
<p>The lawsuit specifically asks the court to prevent these people and entities from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating and promoting the sale of fake accounts, likes, and followers on Facebook and Instagram</li>
<li>Infringing on our trademarks on their websites</li>
<li>Using Facebook branded domain names to operate their websites (i.e. cyber squatting)</li>
</ul>
<p>Inauthentic activity has no place on our platform. That’s why we devote significant resources to detecting and stopping this behavior, including disabling millions of fake accounts every day. Today’s lawsuit is one more step in our ongoing efforts to protect people on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

6,"December 28, 2018","<div class=""post-content"">
<p>Yesterday, The New York Times published an article about the way we moderate content on Facebook. We’ve been accused of being “ad hoc, ” “disorganized,” “secretive,” and doing things “on the cheap.” This couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>We welcome debate about how to help keep Facebook a safe place where people can express their ideas. But that debate should be based on facts, not mischaracterizations. Here’s where we disagree with the Times:</p>
<p><b>Our policies are public, not “secret” or “closely held.”</b><br/>
For years, we’ve published our Community Standards, the overarching guide that outlines what is and isn’t allowed on Facebook. <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/comprehensive-community-standards/"">Earlier this year</a> we went a step further and published the internal guidelines we use to enforce those standards. Anyone can view them at <a href=""http://facebook.com/communitystandards"">facebook.com/communitystandards</a>.</p>
<p><b>Our policies are carefully considered, not “ad hoc” responses.</b><br/>
The Times is right that we regularly update our policies to account for ever-changing cultural and linguistic norms around the world. But the process is far from “ad hoc.” We make changes to our policies based on new trends that our reviewers see, feedback from inside and outside the company, as well as unexpected, and sometimes dramatic, changes on the ground. And we publish the changes we make every month.</p>
<p>What the Times refers to as a gathering “over breakfast” among “young engineers and lawyers” is, in fact, a global forum held every two weeks where we discuss potential changes to our policies. It includes experts from around the world with deep knowledge of relevant laws, online safety, counter-terrorism, operations, public policy, communications, product, and diversity. Yes, lawyers and engineers are present, but so are human rights experts, people who have studied hate and extremist organizations, former law enforcement and other public servants, and academics. As part of this process, we seek input from people outside Facebook so we can better understand multiple perspectives on safety and expression, as well as the impact of our policies on different communities.</p>
<p>Last month we started <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/11/enforcing-our-community-standards-2/#forum-minutes"">publishing minutes</a> from these meetings, and early next year we plan to include a change log so that people can track updates to our Community Standards over time.</p>
<p><b>The people enforcing our policies are focused on accuracy, not quotas.</b><br/>
The team responsible for safety on Facebook is made up of around 30,000 people, about <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/07/hard-questions-content-reviewers/"">15,000 of whom are</a><a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/07/hard-questions-content-reviewers/""> content reviewers</a> around the world, as the Times updated its story to note. Contrary to what the story reports, content reviewers don’t have quotas for the amount of reports they have to complete. Reviewers’ compensation is not based on the amount of content they review, and our reviewers aren’t expected to rely on Google Translate as they are supplied with training and supporting resources.</p>
<p>We hire reviewers for their language expertise and cultural context — we review content in over 50 languages — and we encourage them to take the time they need to review reports. They work in more than 20 sites around the world, which resemble Facebook’s own offices, and they provide 24/7 support. As the Times notes, some reviewers are based in Morocco and the Philippines, while others are based in the United States, Germany, Latvia, Spain and other locations around the world.</p>
<p><b>We’ve taken a careful approach in Myanmar based on feedback from experts.</b><br/>
When discussing our efforts to curb hate speech in Myanmar, the Times incorrectly claims that a paperwork error allowed an extremist group to remain on Facebook. In fact, we had designated the group – Ma Ba Tha – as a hate organization in April 2018, six months before The Times first contacted us for this story. While there was one outdated training deck in circulation, we immediately began removing content that represents, praises or supports the organization in April – both through proactive sweeps for this content and upon receiving user reports.</p>
<p>This was one of <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/08/update-on-myanmar/"">several</a> <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/08/removing-myanmar-officials/"">steps</a> we’ve taken in Myanmar in 2018. Another covered in the story was <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/08/removing-myanmar-officials/"">our decision</a> to remove Facebook accounts belonging to senior military officials in Myanmar without notifying the government. We did this based on guidance from international experts, who cautioned us as to potential reactions from the military, the blame that could be placed on the government, and the risk to people’s safety on the ground.</p>
<p>—<br/>
We play an important role in how people communicate, and with that comes an expectation that we’ll constantly identify ways we can do better. That’s how it should be. And it’s why we constantly work with experts around the world to listen to their ideas and criticism, and make changes where they’re warranted. Throughout 2018, we’ve introduced more transparency into our policies and provided data on how we enforce them. We’ve got more in store in 2019, and we look forward to people’s feedback.</p>

<p><i>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ngleicher"">Nathaniel Gleicher</a>, Head of Cybersecurity Policy</i></p>
<p>Today we removed nine Facebook Pages and six Facebook accounts for engaging in <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/inside-feed-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/"">coordinated inauthentic behavior</a> on our platform in Bangladesh. Through our investigation, which began in part based on a tip from Graphika, a threat intelligence company that we work with, we discovered that these Pages were designed to look like independent news outlets and posted pro-government and anti-opposition content. Our investigation indicates that this activity is linked to individuals associated with the Bangladesh government. This kind of behavior is not allowed on Facebook under our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/misrepresentation"">misrepresentation policy</a> because we don’t want people or organizations creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they are, or what they’re doing. Here’s a breakdown of what we’ve found:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Presence on Facebook: </i>9 Facebook Pages, 6 Facebook accounts.</li>
<li><i>Followers:</i><i> </i>About 11,900 people followed at least one of these Facebook Pages.</li>
<li><i>Advertising:</i> Around $800 US dollars in ad spending on Facebook. The first ad was run in July 2017, and the last was run in November 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we have done with other investigations, we have shared our findings with the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensics Research Lab. Here are some sample posts:</p>

<p><em>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Ime"">Ime Archibong</a>, VP of Product Partnerships</em></p>
<p>In the past day, we’ve been accused of disclosing people’s private messages to partners without their knowledge. That’s not true – and we wanted to provide more facts about our messaging partnerships.</p>
<p>We worked closely with four partners to integrate messaging capabilities into their products so people could message their Facebook friends — but only if they chose to use Facebook Login. These experiences are common in our industry — think of being able to have Alexa read your email aloud or to read your email on Apple’s Mail app.</p>
<p>People could message their friends about what they were listening to on Spotify or watching on Netflix, share folders on Dropbox, or get receipts from money transfers through the Royal Bank of Canada app. These experiences <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/14/technology/spotify-music-streaming-service-comes-to-us.html"">were</a> <a href=""https://mashable.com/2014/09/02/netflix-adds-facebook-sharing-controls/#RDPszYIF2PqH"">publicly</a> <a href=""http://www.rbc.com/newsroom/news/2013/20131211-facebook.html"">discussed</a>. And they were clear to users and only available when people logged into these services with Facebook. However, they were experimental and have now been shut down for nearly three years.</p>
<p><b>Why did the messaging partners have read/write/delete messaging access?</b><br/>
That was the point of this feature — for the messaging partners mentioned above, we worked with them to build messaging integrations into their apps so people could send messages to their Facebook friends.</p>
<p>Specifically, we made it possible for people to message their friends what music they were listening to in Spotify or watching on Netflix directly from the Spotify or Netflix apps (see screen shots below), to message links to Dropbox folders (like a collection of photographs) from the Dropbox app, and to message receipts from money transfers through the Royal Bank of Canada app.</p>
<p>In order for you to <i>write</i> a message to a Facebook friend from within Spotify, for instance, we needed to give Spotify “write access.” For you to be able to <i>read</i> messages back, we needed Spotify to have “read access.” “Delete access” meant that if you <i>deleted</i> a message from within Spotify, it would also delete from Facebook. No third party was reading your private messages, or writing messages to your friends without your permission. Many news stories imply we were shipping over private messages to partners, which is not correct.</p>
<p>These partnerships were agreed via extensive negotiations and documentation, detailing how the third party would use the API, and what data they could and couldn’t access.</p>

<p><em>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=678106196"">Konstantinos Papamiltiadis</a>, Director of Developer Platforms and Programs</em></p>
<p>Today, we’re facing questions about whether Facebook gave large tech companies access to people’s information and, if so, why we did this.</p>
<p>To put it simply, this work was about helping people do two things. First, people could access their Facebook accounts or specific Facebook features on devices and platforms built by other companies like Apple, Amazon, Blackberry and Yahoo. These are known as integration partners. Second, people could have more social experiences – like seeing recommendations from their Facebook friends – on other popular apps and websites, like Netflix, The New York Times, Pandora and Spotify.</p>
<p>To be clear: none of these partnerships or features gave companies access to information without people’s permission, nor did they violate our 2012 settlement with the FTC.</p>
<p><b>How did people use these features?</b><br/>
People used these features in many different ways, including through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apps that allowed people to access their Facebook account on their Windows Phone device</li>
<li>Notifications about their activity on Facebook that they could turn on while they were using Safari or other browsers</li>
<li>“Social hubs” that consolidated their feeds across Facebook, Twitter, and other services</li>
<li>Messaging integrations that allowed people to recommend things like songs from Spotify to friends</li>
<li>Search results in Bing and elsewhere based on public information their friends shared</li>
<li>Tools that helped them find friends on Facebook by uploading their contacts from email providers like Yahoo</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve been public about these features and partnerships over the years because we wanted people to actually use them – and many people did. They were discussed, reviewed, and <a href=""https://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/23/how-to-opt-out-of-facebooks-instant-personalization/"">scrutinized</a> by a wide variety of journalists and privacy advocates.</p>
<p>But most of these features are now gone. We shut down instant personalization, which powered Bing’s features, in 2014 and we wound down our partnerships with device and platform companies months ago, following an announcement in <a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/04/24/new-facebook-platform-product-changes-policy-updates/"">April</a>. Still, we recognize that we’ve needed tighter management over how partners and developers can access information using our APIs. We’re already in the process of reviewing all our APIs and the partners who can access them.</p>
<p><b>Who are these integration partners and why did Facebook work with them?</b><br/>
People want to use Facebook features on a variety of devices and products, many of which we don’t support ourselves. This was particularly true early in our history, before Android and iOS became the predominant ways people use the internet on their phones. Text-only and feature phones were widely popular. Across the industry, companies like Facebook partnered with other companies to build integrations. Take the Blackberry Hub app as an example. People using Blackberry devices could log into Facebook using this feature, allowing them to see the same Facebook News Feed they would see if they logged in from a desktop computer. The data we provided allowed the person to access their own account on Blackberry. Blackberry couldn’t use any of the information for its own purposes.</p>
<p>Facebook has had similar integration partnerships over the years with Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo and other companies, which were overseen by our partnerships and product teams. These partners built many kinds of integrations, including mobile versions of Facebook and social feed hubs, which aggregated feeds from Facebook and other companies. We’ve shut down nearly all of these partnerships over the past several months, except with Amazon and Apple, which people continue to find useful and which are covered by active contracts; Tobii, an integration that enables people with ALS to access Facebook; and browser notifications for people who use Alibaba, Mozilla and Opera.</p>
<p><b>Does this mean these companies got access to my Facebook information if I didn’t authorize it? </b><br/>
Our integration partners had to get authorization from people. You would have had to sign in with your Facebook account to use the integration offered by Apple, Amazon or another integration partner.</p>
<p><b>What was instant personalization and how did it work?</b><br/>
Instant personalization is a product we offered with select partners from 2010 to 2014 that involved public information on Facebook, and it’s different from the types of partnerships we’ve described above. With instant personalization, people could link their Facebook account with other services like Rotten Tomatoes or Yelp to see public information their friends shared. When searching on Bing for articles about an upcoming trip to Europe, you could get results based on what your friends had shared publicly. People could turn off instant personalization at any time.</p>
<p><b>Did partners get access to messages?</b><br/>
Yes. But people had to explicitly sign in to Facebook first to use a partner’s messaging feature. Take Spotify for example. After signing in to your Facebook account in Spotify’s desktop app, you could then send and receive messages without ever leaving the app. Our API provided partners with access to the person’s messages in order to power this type of feature. <em><strong>(Update on December 19, 2018 at 5:15PM PT: For more on Facebook’s messaging partnerships, see VP of Product Partnerships <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/12/facebooks-messaging-partnerships/"">Ime Archibong’s post</a>.)</strong></em></p>
<p><b>Why did some partners have access to data as late as 2017, even after instant personalization was shut down?</b><br/>
Instant personalization only involved public information, and we have no evidence that data was used or misused after the program was shut down. However, we shouldn’t have left the APIs in place after we shut down instant personalization. We’ve taken a number of steps this year to limit developers’ access to people’s Facebook information, and as part of that ongoing effort, we’re in the midst of reviewing all our APIs and the partners who can access them. This is important work that builds on our existing systems that track APIs and control who can access to them.</p>

<p><em>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sheryl"">Sheryl Sandberg</a>, Chief Operating Officer</em></p>
<p>Earlier this year, we launched <u><a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/11/facebook-community-boost/"">Facebook Community Boost</a></u>. We’ve now visited 50 cities across the country, offering digital skills training to small businesses and job seekers. We started in St. Louis in March and I’m excited that this week we’re hosting the final event of the year in my hometown – Miami.</p>
<p>We want to make sure no one is left behind in an economy where digital skills are critical. Over the next three days, we’re offering trainings on everything from getting online for the first time to creating content for mobile devices. Experts will be on hand to answer questions one-on-one and the event is free for everyone to attend at the James L. Knight Center (400 SE 2nd Ave, 3rd Floor) today through Thursday.</p>
<p>Through Community Boost events like this one, we’re getting closer to our goal of training 1 million people in the US in digital skills by 2020. This year we teamed up with 20 community colleges and 100 organizations across the country to help reach as many people as possible. Here in Miami, we’re partnering with Miami Dade Community College to prepare graduates for careers in the digital world.</p>
<p>There are 90 million businesses on Facebook, the majority of which are small businesses. More than half of them say they’ve hired more people since joining Facebook. This is so important because small businesses create most of the jobs almost everywhere in the world. In Miami-Dade County, more than 82,000 small businesses employ more than half of the workforce. We want to continue supporting entrepreneurs in Miami even after Community Boost is over, so we’re providing the Miami Bayside Foundation with a grant to offer microloans to underrepresented small businesses.</p>
<p>We’re proud of how people are using our products to make a difference in their economies and communities — and we’re committed to helping even more people thrive.</p>
<p>You can register for Community Boost and stay up to date with the latest city announcements, news and program schedules at <u><a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__fbcommunityboost.com_&amp;d=DwMF-g&amp;c=5VD0RTtNlTh3ycd41b3MUw&amp;r=kgHHvzdb9AUlvGoTZAwqwA&amp;m=H-uMR9_luowIKL4HnxoS95xlL6vb4uZzQL_UGDs5Z9c&amp;s=0T2DLwA1Uog6oiigsEmcU67PWr1ubHXGcAOlukCFmkU&amp;e="">fbcommunityboost.com</a></u>.</p>

<p>Civil rights are core to American values of equality, dignity and freedom from discrimination. Advancing civil rights benefits all of us and is what we stand for as a people.</p>
<p>In May, we accepted the call to undertake a civil rights audit. We asked Laura Murphy, a highly respected civil rights and civil liberties leader, to guide the audit. After speaking with more than 90 civil rights organizations, today Laura is providing an important update on our progress.</p>
<p>Facebook is committed to working with leading US civil rights organizations to strengthen and advance civil rights on our service. They’ve raised a number of important concerns, and I’m grateful for their candor and guidance. We know that we need to do more: to listen, look deeper and take action to respect fundamental rights.</p>
<p>In these first six months, Laura’s work helped us build upon crucial election-related efforts such as expanding our policy prohibiting voter suppression. We updated our policy to expressly ban misrepresentations about how to vote, such as claims that you can vote using an online app, and statements about whether a vote will be counted. Other misinformation related to voting – including false claims of polling place closures, long lines, and wait times – is proactively sent to third-party fact-checkers for review. The revised policy also prohibits threats of violence related to voting or voter registration. As a direct response to feedback from civil rights advocates, we are focusing on voter suppression as a distinct civil rights challenge and will continue this work to be better prepared for future elections.</p>
<p>Two independent reports commissioned by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence released Monday on the Russian Internet Research Agency’s use of technology around the 2016 election suggest that the IRA’s efforts had a disproportionate impact on communities of color.  We take this incredibly seriously, as demonstrated by the investments we’ve made in safety and security.</p>
<p>In addition to working to prevent voter suppression, we’re also building on our efforts to encourage voter registration and engagement. When people turn 18, and ahead of elections, we remind them to register to vote. We help them find their polling places and remind them to vote on Election Day. This year, we also added a feature that lets people ask their friends to join them in registering to vote. As a result of these efforts, Facebook and Instagram helped register an estimated 2 million people in 2018, according to our nonpartisan partner TurboVote.</p>
<p>We know we need to do more. Laura’s report includes areas where we can and should do better – and we’re working hard to address these concerns. We also announced when this process began that we’re engaging with the noted civil rights law firm Relman, Dane and Colfax, to provide legal analysis and advice. We will include information about their ongoing work in future updates.</p>
<p>The civil rights audit is deeply important to me, and it’s one of my top priorities for 2019. I’m committed to overseeing its progress and making sure that it is a well-resourced, cross-company effort. I’m grateful to all of the leaders and advocates who have contributed to the audit this year, and I look forward to continuing this important work with them in the future.</p>

<p><i>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/meredith.carden"">Meredith Carden</a></i>,<i> Head of News Integrity Partnerships</i></p>
<p>Today The Guardian published a story about our <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/hard-questions-fact-checking/"">third-party fact-checking program</a>. We’d like to provide a response, as the piece presents several inaccuracies, and is based primarily on the account of a single fact-checker who hasn’t been involved with the Facebook fact-checking program for six months. We provided information to The Guardian, but they chose not to include all of it.</p>
<p>We have been committed to fighting misinformation for years now and have strong relationships with our third-party fact-checking partners — we now have 35 partners in 24 countries around the world. We value our ongoing partnerships and the work that these journalists do, and we’re planning to expand the program to even more countries in 2019.</p>
<p><b>Ensuring Process Integrity and Avoiding Conflicts of Interest</b></p>
<p>Contrary to a claim in the story, we absolutely do not ask fact-checkers to prioritize debunking content about our advertisers.</p>
<p>In reality, here’s how fact-checking works: the primary way we surface potentially false news to third-party fact-checkers is via <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/inside-feed-misinformation-zigmond/"">machine learning</a>, which relies on a number of signals like <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/06/inside-feed-how-people-help-fight-false-news/"">feedback</a> from people who use Facebook and the number of comments expressing disbelief (e.g., “No way this is real!”). Fact-checkers then go through a list of this potentially false content and choose for themselves what to fact-check — they are under no obligation to fact-check anything from the list, and if they’d like, they can rate stories that Facebook hasn’t added to the list (which they often do). As soon as something is rated “false,” it is automatically de-prioritized in News Feed, and where it does appear, we’ll show <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/news-feed-fyi-updates-in-our-fight-against-misinformation/"">Related Articles</a> including the fact-checker’s article below it. These processes are automated.</p>
<p><b>Efficacy of Fact-Checking</b></p>
<p>Fact-checking is highly effective in fighting misinformation: when something is rated “false” by a fact-checker, we’re able to reduce future impressions of that content by an average of 80%. We also leverage these ratings to take action on Pages and websites that repeatedly share misinformation. We de-prioritize <i>all</i> content from actors who repeatedly get “false” ratings on content they share, and we remove their advertising and monetization rights.</p>
<p><a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/10/inside-feed-michigan-lemonde/"">Three new separate pieces of research</a> have all found that the overall volume of false news on Facebook is decreasing since we put our third-party fact-checking program and other anti-misinformation measures in place. We’re also providing independent researchers at <a href=""https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__techcrunch.com_2018_07_11_facebook-2Dindependent-2Dresearch-2Dcommission-2Dsocial-2Dscience-2Done-2Dwill-2Dshare-2Da-2Dpetabyte-2Dof-2Duser-2Ddata_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=5VD0RTtNlTh3ycd41b3MUw&amp;r=7vt4S1forpwVxsyOtG60lg&amp;m=glZzAoJs_VPRdB-Al6gmjveQu9SBOL37t-b_d6PiYtc&amp;s=oAfQt4H_UlOsyhNE1xE03shbcrgy4D6um1VDdloiUC0&amp;e="">Social Science One</a> with a privacy-protected data set that will help them study the effects of misinformation on social media and elections. This research may help us better measure volumes of false news — and our progress against it — over time.</p>
<p>We have heard feedback from our partners that they’d like more data on the impact of their efforts, so we’re starting to send fact-checkers quarterly reports that include customized statistics that reflect the work and impact of each fact-checker.</p>
<p><b>Safety of Journalists and Fact-Checking Partners</b></p>
<p>We take the safety of journalists seriously. Through the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/business/e/courses/journalists"">Facebook Journalism Project</a>, we provide online safety resources, including information on how to turn on two-factor authentication, manage privacy settings, block harassment, control location sharing, report abusive content and impersonation, and more. Our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/credible_violence"">Community Standards</a> on credible violence aim to protect journalists and other vulnerable people or groups. We remove content, disable accounts, and work with local authorities when we become aware of content that we believe poses a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to safety.</p>
<p><b>Fact-Checking Ratings</b></p>
<p>We share specific rating guidelines with our third-party partners, and we make these <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/help/publisher/182222309230722"">publicly available</a> so publishers and others have insight into our program. We’ve also started to provide safety training as part of onboarding our new partners, and we’re working to expand this to our existing partners as well.</p>
<p>Misinformation is an ever-evolving problem that we’re committed to fighting globally, and the work that third-party fact-checkers do to help review content on Facebook is a valued and important piece of this effort.</p>

<p><em>By Tessa Lyons, Product Manager</em></p>
<p>Facebook is about connecting you to the people that matter most. And discussing the news can be one way to start a meaningful conversation with friends or family. It’s why helping to ensure that you get accurate information on Facebook is so important to us.</p>
<p>Today, we’re announcing two changes which we believe will help in our fight against false news. First, we will no longer use Disputed Flags to identify false news. Instead we’ll use <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/04/news-feed-fyi-new-test-with-related-articles/"">Related Articles</a> to help give people more context about the story. <a href=""https://medium.com/facebook-design/designing-against-misinformation-e5846b3aa1e2"">Here’s why</a>.</p>
<p>Academic research on correcting misinformation has shown that putting a strong image, like a red flag, next to an article may actually entrench deeply held beliefs – the opposite effect to what we intended. Related Articles, by contrast, are simply designed to give more context, which our research has shown is a more effective way to help people get to the facts. Indeed, we’ve found that when we show Related Articles next to a false news story, it leads to fewer shares than when the Disputed Flag is shown.</p>
<p>Second, we are starting a new initiative to better understand how people decide whether information is accurate or not based on the news sources they depend upon. This will not directly impact News Feed in the near term. However, it may help us better measure our success in improving the quality of information on Facebook over time.</p>
<p>False news undermines the unique value that Facebook offers: the ability for you to connect with family and friends in meaningful ways. It’s why we’re investing in better technology and more people to help prevent the spread of misinformation. Overall, we’re making progress. Demoting false news (as identified by fact-checkers) is one of our best weapons because demoted articles typically lose 80 percent of their traffic. This destroys the economic incentives spammers and troll farms have to generate these articles in the first place.</p>
<p>But there’s much more to do. By showing Related Articles rather than Disputed Flags we can help give people better context. And understanding how people decide what’s false and what’s not will be crucial to our success over time. Please keep giving us your feedback because we’ll be redoubling our efforts in 2018.</p>

14,"December 19, 2017","<div class=""post-content"">
<p><i>By Antigone Davis, Global Head of Safety</i></p>
<p>Today we are announcing new tools to prevent harassment on Facebook and in Messenger – part of our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/mark-zuckerberg/building-global-community/10154544292806634?qid=339663931&amp;mf_story_key=10103508221158471"">ongoing efforts</a> to build a safe community.</p>
<p>Based on feedback from people who use Facebook, as well as organizations representing groups who disproportionately experience harassment like <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2017/07/11/online-harassment-2017/?utm_content=buffer08d0c&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer"">women</a> and <a href=""https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/gender-society/internet-harassment-online-threats-targeting-women-research-review"">journalists</a>, we are introducing new features that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proactively recognize and help prevent unwanted contact like friend requests and messages when someone you blocked sets up a new account or tries to contact you from another account they control</li>
<li>Provide the option to ignore a Messenger conversation and automatically move it out of your inbox, without having to block the sender</li>
</ul>
<p>We already prohibit bullying and harassment on Facebook, and people can let us know when they see something concerning or have a bad experience. We review reports and take action on abuse, like removing content, disabling accounts, and limiting certain features like commenting for people who have violated our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards"">Community Standards</a>. People can also control what they share, who they share it with, and who can communicate with them. These new features for personal profiles give people additional ways to manage their experience on Facebook.</p>
<p><b>Preventing unwanted contact</b></p>
<p>We’ve heard stories from people who have blocked someone only to encounter the same harasser using a different account. In order to help prevent those bad encounters, we are building on existing features that prevent fake and inauthentic accounts on Facebook.</p>
<p>These automated features help us identify fake accounts more quickly and block millions of them at registration every day. However, sometimes a new account created by someone who was previously blocked might not get caught by these features.</p>
<p>We are now using various signals (like an IP address) to help us proactively recognize this type of account and prevent its owner from sending a message or friend request to the person who blocked the original account. The person who blocked the original account is in control, and must initiate contact with the new account in order for them to interact normally.</p>
<p><b>Ignoring messages</b></p>
<p>If someone is being harassed, blocking the abuser sometimes prompts additional harassment, particularly offline. We’ve also heard from groups that work with survivors of domestic violence that being able to see messages is often a valuable tool to assess if there is risk of additional abuse.</p>
<p>Now, you can tap on a message to ignore the conversation. This disables notifications and moves the conversation from your inbox to your Filtered Messages folder. You can read messages in the conversation without the sender seeing if they’ve been read. This feature is now available for one on one conversations and will soon be available broadly for group messages, too.</p>
<p><b>Working with experts</b></p>
<p>Facebook works with experts in a variety of fields to provide safety resources to people. For example, we’ve developed new <a href=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/a-guide-to-staying-safe-on-facebook.pdf"">resources</a> for survivors of domestic violence in partnership with the National Network to End Domestic Violence. This is in addition to our work with more than 150 safety experts over the last year in India, Ireland, Kenya, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Sweden and the US to get feedback on ways we can improve.</p>
<p>We have also convened roundtables with the <a href=""https://media.fb.com/2017/01/11/facebook-journalism-project/"">Facebook Journalism Project</a> to learn more about the unique experiences of the journalist community on Facebook. This culminated in the features we’re making available today, as well as <a href=""https://media.fb.com/2017/06/23/introducing-facebook-safety-for-journalists-resources/"">resources</a> for journalists to help them protect their themselves on Facebook.</p>

<p><em>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/joaquin.quinonero.candela"">Joaquin Quiñonero Candela</a>, Director, Applied Machine Learning</em></p>
<p>Today we’re announcing new, optional tools to help people better manage their identity on Facebook using face recognition. Powered by the same <a href=""https://vimeo.com/136019107"">technology</a> we’ve used to suggest friends you may want to tag in photos or videos, these new features help you find photos that you’re not tagged in and help you detect when others might be attempting to use your image as their profile picture. We’re also introducing a way for people who are visually impaired to know more about who is in the photos they encounter on Facebook.</p>
<p>People gave us feedback that they would find it easier to manage face recognition through a simple setting, so we’re pairing these tools with a single “on/off” control. If your tag suggestions setting is currently set to “none,” then your default face recognition setting will be set to “off” and will remain that way until you decide to change it.</p>
<p><b>Know When You Appear in Photos on Facebook </b></p>
<p>Now, if you’re in a photo and are part of the audience for that post, we’ll notify you, even if you haven’t been tagged. You’re in control of your image on Facebook and can make choices such as whether to tag yourself, leave yourself untagged, or reach out to the person who posted the photo if you have concerns about it. We always respect the privacy setting people select when posting a photo on Facebook (whether that’s friends, public or a custom audience), so you won’t receive a notification if you’re not in the audience.</p>

<p><b>Profile Photo Safety </b></p>
<p>We want people to feel confident when they post pictures of themselves on Facebook so we’ll soon begin using face recognition technology to let people know when someone else uploads a photo of them as their profile picture. We’re doing this to prevent people from impersonating others on Facebook.</p>
<p><b>New Tools for People with Visual Impairments</b></p>
<p>We’re always working to make it easier for all people, regardless of ability, to access Facebook, make connections and have more opportunities. Two years ago, we launched an <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/zuck/videos/10102456212502251/"">automatic alt-text tool</a>, which describes photos to people with vision loss. Now, with face recognition, people who use screen readers will know who appears in photos in their News Feed even if people aren’t tagged.</p>

<p><b>How it Works and the Choices You Have</b></p>
<p>Since 2010, face recognition technology has helped bring people closer together on Facebook. Our technology analyzes the pixels in photos you’re already tagged in and generates a string of numbers we call a template. When photos and videos are uploaded to our systems, we compare those images to the template.</p>
<p>You control whether Facebook can recognize you in photos and videos. Soon, you will begin to see a simple on/off switch instead of settings for individual features that use face recognition technology. We designed this as an on/off switch because people gave us feedback that they prefer a simpler control than having to decide for every single feature using face recognition technology.

<p><i>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/rmsherman"">Rob Sherman</a>, Deputy Chief Privacy Officer</i></p>
<p>The words “face recognition” can make some people feel uneasy, conjuring dystopian scenes from science fiction. Can someone use it to identify strangers on the street? Are institutions gathering mass databases of images that can be used to invade someone’s privacy or rights?</p>
<p>As government and non-government agencies, companies and others use face recognition technology in new ways, people want to understand how their privacy is being protected and what choices they have over how this technology is used.</p>
<p>Like many tools, face recognition can be used for good purposes — like helping people securely unlock their mobile devices, log into their bank accounts and make digital payments. It can help people organize their photos and share them with friends. It’s even being used to find missing and kidnapped children and to help officials confirm whether travelers have authentic passports.</p>
<p>But it can also be used in concerning ways. Some have <a href=""https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.franken.senate.gov%2F%3Fp%3Dpress_release%26id%3D3759&amp;h=ATMg7063FJADDeEXsQ94-iIeD73AaR9ze4PQLqka8rRYB9HMbVsB8Ei75dDta-DrRjdrSf5AUFLlNLmccGuPU3t_fdpl02DvfCi9aV-8ZdK-SQGGkMzy1yL1GaKjd6Z3vRbhvPYU0KD30iOYL-ss6M_T0XfQpQq-"">raised concerns</a> about how law enforcement uses the technology. Others have <a href=""https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theatlantic.com%2Ftechnology%2Farchive%2F2016%2F04%2Fthe-underlying-bias-of-facial-recognition-systems%2F476991%2F&amp;h=ATOC7GftqujonBadZmhXhgO9AYmb0-LNh7r4RLg5yhQAIyYCfjppYVd3X7-neA-QDyih5WRn9HbT6vY7pGpfOkLr8QwlJ7Fv7OG6h7kXMZS_dfyp9CS2ZX0-ZkKynxF7oSVITTcIoowiL-s2AnwCWLowiNNXUEIi"">called attention to</a> the potential for racial bias, arguing that facial recognition systems are more likely either to misidentify or fail to identify African Americans than people of other races. And while there have been proposals to regulate face recognition, there’s no consensus on whether or how to do so, and some approaches have been criticized for failing to focus on the most harmful potential uses.</p>
<p>This tension isn’t new. Society often welcomes the benefit of a new innovation while struggling to harness its potential. “Beware the Kodak,” one newspaper intoned in 1888 as inexpensive equipment came onto the market making photography available to the masses. They called it a “new terror for the picnic.” Confronting amateur photography for the first time, society could have restricted this technology – and fundamentally changed the way history was documented for more than a century. Instead, regulators took action on uses that raised concerns — for example, by prohibiting stalking or letting people sue for invasion of privacy — rather than requiring licenses to use “camera technology” or written consent forms before a person could appear in a photo. As a result, people became familiar with these early cameras, social norms evolved, and the world decided that the benefits of personal photography far outweighed the risks.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Face Recognition and Facebook</strong></p>
<p>On Facebook, face recognition helps people tag photos with the names of their friends. When you have face recognition enabled, our technology analyzes the pixels in photos you’re already tagged in and generates a string of numbers we call a template. When photos and videos are uploaded to our systems, we compare those images to the template. Here’s a video explaining how it works:</p>
<div class=""fb-video"" data-allowfullscreen=""true"" data-href=""https://www.facebook.com/facebook/videos/10156872585996729/""></div>
<p>When we first introduced this feature <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/making-photo-tagging-easier/467145887130/"">in 2010</a>, there was no industry standard for how people should be able to control face recognition.We decided to notify people on Facebook and provide a way to disable it in their account <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=timeline%C2%A7ion=suggestions&amp;view"">settings</a> at any time.</p>
<p>We recently announced new features that use face recognition technology. People can now find photos of themselves even when they aren’t tagged in them, making it possible for people to manage their privacy in new ways. They may also know when someone is using their image as a profile photo — which can help stop impersonation. In addition, those with vision impairments can now hear aloud who’s in the photos they come across on Facebook. Just as in 2010, we had to evaluate how we’d inform people and give them choice over these new uses of the technology.</p>
<p><strong>Our Responsibility</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to face recognition, control matters. We listen carefully to feedback from people who use Facebook, as well as from experts in the field. We believe we have a responsibility to build these features in ways that deliver on the technology’s promise, while avoiding harmful ways that some might use it.</p>
<p>Our team has been working for more than a year to collect and respond to feedback on how people want to see us use this technology — and how we can do it most responsibly. People asked us to explain how face recognition works more clearly, and to provide more prominent information about how we might use it on Facebook. To address this feedback, we’re informing people about updates to face recognition in News Feed – the doorstep of Facebook.</p>
<p>We also decided to update Facebook’s settings. Concerns about updated settings are as old as Facebook, so we didn’t take the decision lightly. But we learned in our research that people want a way to completely turn off face recognition technology rather than on a feature-by-feature basis. We knew that as we introduced more features using this technology, most people would find it easier to manage one master setting rather than navigate a long list of products deciding what they want and what they don’t. Our new setting is an on/off switch. Some may criticize this as an “all or nothing” approach, but we believe this will prevent people from having to make additional decisions among potentially confusing options.</p>
<p>Finally, we aren’t introducing, and have no plans to introduce, features that tell strangers who you are. This was a common concern we heard from people when we researched new features that rely on face recognition technology.</p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>Moving Forward</strong></p>
<p>As people use features on Facebook that use face recognition technology, we’ll learn more about what our community thinks of them — good, bad or in between. And we’ll learn what they think of our updated controls. We’ll build on these lessons and keep people informed about the work we’re doing to innovate and responsibly use this technology on Facebook.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s too early to know if face recognition will follow the path of the personal camera. But we look forward to the public’s feedback and to working with other companies and organizations as we continue to listen and learn.</p>

<p><i>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/chris.sonderby"">Chris Sonderby</a>, Deputy General Counsel</i></p>
<p>Today we are releasing our <a href=""https://transparency.facebook.com/"">Transparency Report</a>, previously called the Government Requests Report, for the first half of 2017. For the first time, we are expanding the report beyond government requests to provide data regarding reports from rights holders related to intellectual property (IP) — covering copyright, trademark, and counterfeit. The report also includes the same categories of information we’ve disclosed in the past, with updates on government requests for account data, content restrictions, and internet disruptions.</p>
<p>We believe that sharing information about IP reports we receive from rights holders is an important step toward being more open and clear about how we protect the people and businesses that use our services. Our Transparency Report describes these policies and procedures in more detail, along with the steps we’ve taken to safeguard the people who use Facebook and keep them informed about IP. It also includes data covering the volume and nature of copyright, trademark, and counterfeit reports we’ve received and the amount of content affected by those reports. For example, in the first half of 2017, we received 224,464 copyright reports about content on Facebook, 41,854 trademark reports, and 14,279 counterfeit reports.</p>
<p>In addition to our new section on intellectual property, we are also providing our usual twice-a-year update on government requests for account data, content restrictions based on local law, and information about internet disruptions in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Requests for account data increased by 21% globally compared to the second half of 2016, from 64,279 to 78,890. Fifty-seven percent of the data requests we received from law enforcement in the U.S. contained a non-disclosure order that prohibited us from notifying the user, up from 50% in our last report. Additionally, as a result of transparency reforms introduced in 2016 by the USA Freedom Act, the U.S. government notified us that it was lifting the non-disclosure order on five National Security Letters (NSLs) we previously received between 2012 and 2015. Copies of the NSLs, as well as the government’s authorization letters are available for download below.</p>
<p>We continue to carefully scrutinize each request we receive for account data — whether from an authority in the U.S., Europe, or elsewhere — to make sure it is legally sufficient. If a request appears to be deficient or overly broad, we push back, and will fight in court, if necessary. We’ll also keep working with partners in industry and civil society to encourage governments around the world to reform surveillance in a way that protects their citizens’ safety and security while respecting their rights and freedoms.</p>
<p>Overall, the number of content restrictions for violating local law increased by 304% globally, compared to the second half of 2016, from 6,944 to 28,036. This increase was primarily driven by a request from Mexican law enforcement to remove instances of a video depicting a school shooting in Monterrey in January. We restricted access in Mexico to 20,506 instances of the video in the first half of 2017.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there were 52 disruptions of Facebook services in nine countries in the first half of 2017, compared to 43 disruptions in 20 countries in the second half of 2016. We continue to be deeply concerned by internet disruptions, which can create barriers for businesses and prevent people from sharing and communicating with their family and friends.</p>
<p>Publishing this report reinforces our important commitment to transparency as we build community and bring the world closer together.</p>

<p>People have told us that they dislike spammy posts on Facebook that goad them into interacting with likes, shares, comments, and other actions. For example, “LIKE this if you’re an Aries!” This tactic, known as “engagement bait,” seeks to take advantage of our News Feed algorithm by boosting engagement in order to get greater reach. So, starting this week, we will begin demoting individual posts from people and Pages that use engagement bait.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""aligncenter size-large wp-image-9444"" data-attachment-id=""9444"" data-comments-opened=""0"" data-image-description="""" data-image-meta='{""aperture"":""0"",""credit"":"""",""camera"":"""",""caption"":"""",""created_timestamp"":""0"",""copyright"":"""",""focal_length"":""0"",""iso"":""0"",""shutter_speed"":""0"",""title"":"""",""orientation"":""0""}' data-image-title=""Combo1"" data-large-file=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=960&amp;h=683"" data-medium-file=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=300"" data-orig-file=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png"" data-orig-size=""1972,1402"" data-permalink=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/news-feed-fyi-fighting-engagement-bait-on-facebook/combo1/"" height=""683"" sizes=""(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"" src=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=960&amp;h=683"" srcset=""https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=960&amp;h=683 960w, https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=1920&amp;h=1366 1920w, https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=563&amp;h=400 563w, https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=300&amp;h=213 300w, https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=768&amp;h=546 768w, https://fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/combo1.png?w=1024&amp;h=728 1024w"" width=""960""/></p>
<p>To help us foster more authentic engagement, teams at Facebook have reviewed and categorized hundreds of thousands of posts to inform a machine learning model that can detect different types of engagement bait. Posts that use this tactic will be shown less in News Feed.</p>
<p>Additionally, over the coming weeks, we will begin implementing stricter demotions for Pages that systematically and repeatedly use engagement bait to artificially gain reach in News Feed. We will roll out this Page-level demotion over the course of several weeks to give publishers time to adapt and avoid inadvertently using engagement bait in their posts. Moving forward, we will continue to find ways to improve and scale our efforts to reduce engagement bait.</p>
<p>Posts that ask people for help, advice, or recommendations, such as circulating a missing child report, raising money for a cause, or asking for travel tips, will not be adversely impacted by this update.</p>
<p>Instead, we will demote posts that go against one of our key News Feed values — <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/06/building-a-better-news-feed-for-you/"">authenticity</a>. Similar to our other recent efforts to demote <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/05/news-feed-fyi-new-updates-to-reduce-clickbait-headlines/"">clickbait headlines</a> and links to <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/05/reducing-links-to-low-quality-web-page-experiences/"">low-quality web page experiences</a>, we want to reduce the spread of content that is spammy, sensational, or misleading in order to promote more meaningful and authentic conversations on Facebook.</p>

<p><b>How will this impact Pages?</b><br/>
Publishers and other businesses that use engagement bait tactics in their posts should expect their reach on these posts to decrease. Meanwhile, Pages that repeatedly share engagement bait posts will see more significant drops in reach. Page Admins should continue to focus on posting relevant and meaningful stories that do not use engagement bait tactics.

<p><strong><i>Update 4/4:</i></strong> In December, we announced that we would begin demoting individual posts in English from people and Pages that use engagement bait. We recently expanded this to Spanish, Arabic, French, Italian, and German posts as well, and today are also extending this to posts in Portuguese.</p>
<p><strong>Update 4/26: </strong>Starting today, we have expanded this to posts in Mandarin, Hindi, Indonesian, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Thai, and Turkish.</p>
<p><strong>Update 6/25:</strong> Starting today, we have expanded this to posts in Bengali, Bulgarian, Dutch, Greek, Hungarian, Korean, Malay, Polish, and Romanian.</p>
<p><strong>Update 11/13:</strong> Starting today, we will be demoting comments which contain engagement bait.</p>
<p><strong>Update 1/30/19:</strong> Starting today, we will be demoting videos which contain engagement bait in the audio.</p>

19,"December 15, 2017","<div class=""post-content"">
<p><i>By <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ginsberg1"">David Ginsberg</a>, Director of Research, and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mburke"">Moira Burke</a>, Research Scientist at Facebook</i></p>
<p>With people spending more time on social media, many rightly wonder whether that time is good for us. Do people connect in meaningful ways online? Or are they simply consuming trivial updates and polarizing memes at the expense of time with loved ones?</p>
<p>These are critical questions for Silicon Valley — and for both of us. Moira is a social psychologist who has studied the impact of the internet on people’s lives for more than a decade, and I lead the research team for the Facebook app. As parents, each of us worries about our kids’ screen time and what “connection” will mean in 15 years. We also worry about spending too much time on our phones when we should be paying attention to our families. One of the ways we combat our inner struggles is with research — reviewing what others have found, conducting our own, and asking questions when we need to learn more.</p>
<p>A lot of smart people are looking at different aspects of this important issue. Psychologist Sherry Turkle <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/sherry_turkle_alone_together"">asserts</a> that mobile phones redefine modern relationships, making us “alone together.” In her generational analyses of teens, psychologist Jean Twenge <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/"">notes</a> an increase in teen depression corresponding with technology use. Both offer compelling research.</p>
<p>But it’s not the whole story. Sociologist Claude Fischer <a href=""http://bostonreview.net/blog/claude-fischer-sherry-turkle-smart-phone-social-communication"">argues</a> that claims that technology drives us apart are largely supported by anecdotes and ignore the benefits. Sociologist Keith Hampton’s study of public spaces <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/19/magazine/technology-is-not-driving-us-apart-after-all.html"">suggests</a> that people spend more time in public now — and that cell phones in public are more often used by people passing time on their own, rather than ignoring friends in person.</p>
<p>We want Facebook to be a place for meaningful interactions with your friends and family — enhancing your relationships offline, not detracting from them. After all, that’s what Facebook has always been about. This is important as we know that a person’s health and happiness <a href=""http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000316"">relies heavily</a> on the strength of their relationships.</p>
<p>In this post, we want to give you some insights into how the research team at Facebook works with our product teams to incorporate well-being principles, and review some of the top scientific research on well-being and social media that informs our work. Of course, this isn’t just a Facebook issue — it’s an internet issue — so we collaborate with leading experts and publish in the top peer-reviewed journals. We work with scientists like Robert Kraut at Carnegie Mellon; Sonja Lyubomirsky at UC Riverside; Dacher Keltner, Emiliana Simon-Thomas, and Matt Killingsworth from the <a href=""https://ggsc.berkeley.edu/"">Greater Good Science Center</a> at UC Berkeley, and have partnered closely with mental health clinicians and organizations like <a href=""http://save.org/"">Save.org</a> and the <a href=""https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/"">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a>.</p>
<p><b>What Do Academics Say? Is Social Media Good or Bad for Well-Being?</b></p>
<p>According to the research, it really comes down to <i>how</i> you use the technology. For example, on social media, you can passively scroll through posts, much like watching TV, or actively interact with friends — messaging and commenting on each other’s posts. Just like in person, interacting with people you care about can be beneficial, while simply watching others from the sidelines may make you feel worse.</p>
<p><b>The bad: </b>In general, when people spend a lot of time <b>passively consuming</b> information — reading but not interacting with people — they report feeling worse afterward. In one experiment, University of Michigan students randomly assigned to read Facebook for 10 minutes were in a <a href=""http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-08049-001"">worse mood</a> at the end of the day than students assigned to post or talk to friends on Facebook. A study from UC San Diego and Yale found that people who clicked on about four times as many links as the average person, or who liked twice as many posts, reported <a href=""https://academic.oup.com/aje/article-abstract/185/3/203/2915143"">worse mental health</a> than average in a survey. Though the causes aren’t clear, researchers hypothesize that reading about others online might lead to <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sipr.12033/full"">negative social comparison</a> — and perhaps even more so than offline, since people’s posts are often more curated and flattering. Another theory is that the internet takes people away from social engagement in person.</p>
<p><b>The good:</b> On the other hand, <b>actively interacting with people </b>— especially sharing messages, posts and comments with close friends and reminiscing about past interactions — is linked to improvements in well-being. This ability to connect with relatives, classmates, and colleagues is what drew many of us to Facebook in the first place, and it’s no surprise that staying in touch with these friends and loved ones brings us joy and strengthens our sense of community.</p>
<p>A study we conducted with Robert Kraut at Carnegie Mellon University found that people who sent or received more messages, comments and Timeline posts reported <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcc4.12162/full"">improvements in social support, depression and loneliness</a>. The positive effects were even stronger when people <a href=""http://repository.cmu.edu/dissertations/185/"">talked with their close friends</a> online. Simply <b>broadcasting status updates wasn’t enough</b>; people had to interact one-on-one with others in their network. Other peer-reviewed <a href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0093650215617506"">longitudinal research</a> and <a href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550612469233"">experiments</a> have found similar positive benefits between well-being and <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15534510.2014.893924"">active engagement</a> on Facebook.</p>
<p>In an experiment at Cornell, stressed college students randomly assigned to scroll through their own Facebook profiles for five minutes experienced <a href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167212474694"">boosts in self-affirmation</a> compared to students who looked at a stranger’s Facebook profile. The researchers believe self-affirmation comes from reminiscing on past meaningful interactions — seeing photos they had been tagged in and comments their friends had left — as well as reflecting on one’s own past posts, where a person chooses how to present themselves to the world.</p>
<p>In a follow-up study, the Cornell researchers put other students under stress by giving them negative feedback on a test and then gave them a choice of websites to visit afterward, including Facebook, YouTube, online music and online video games. They found that stressed students were <a href=""http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167212474694"">twice as likely</a> to choose Facebook to make themselves feel better as compared with students who hadn’t been put under stress.</p>
<p>In sum, our research and <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/sipr.12033/full"">other academic literature</a> suggests that it’s about <i>how</i> you use social media that matters when it comes to your well-being.</p>

<p><b>So what are we doing about it?</b></p>
<p>We’re working to make Facebook more about social interaction and less about spending time. As our CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104146268321841"">said</a>, “We want the time people spend on Facebook to encourage meaningful social interactions.” Facebook has always been about bringing people together — from the early days when we started reminding people about their friends’ birthdays, to showing people their memories with friends using the feature we call “On This Day.” We’re also a place for people to come together in times of need, from fundraisers for disaster relief to groups where people can find an organ donor. We’re always working to expand these communities and find new ways to have a positive impact on people’s lives.</p>
<p>We employ social psychologists, social scientists and sociologists, and we collaborate with top scholars to better understand well-being and work to make Facebook a place that contributes in a positive way. Here are a few things we’ve worked on recently to help support people’s well-being.</p>
<p><b>News Feed quality</b>: We’ve made several changes to News Feed to provide more opportunities for meaningful interactions and reduce passive consumption of low-quality content — even if it decreases some of our engagement metrics in the short term. We demote things like <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/05/news-feed-fyi-new-updates-to-reduce-clickbait-headlines/"">clickbait headlines</a> and <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/12/news-feed-fyi-addressing-hoaxes-and-fake-news/"">false news</a>, even though people often click on those links at a high rate. We optimize ranking so <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/06/news-feed-fyi-helping-make-sure-you-dont-miss-stories-from-friends/"">posts from the friends you care about most</a> are more likely to appear at the top of your feed because that’s what people tell us in surveys that they want to see. Similarly, our ranking promotes posts that are<a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/08/news-feed-fyi-showing-you-more-personally-informative-stories/""> personally informative</a>. We also recently <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/08/making-news-feed-an-easier-place-to-connect-and-navigate/"">redesigned the comments feature</a> to foster better conversations.</p>
<p><b>Snooze:</b> People often tell us they want more say over what they see in News Feed. Today, we <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/news-feed-fyi-snooze/"">launched</a> Snooze, which gives people the option to hide a person, Page or group for 30 days, without having to permanently unfollow or unfriend them. This will give people more control over their feed and hopefully make their experience more positive.</p>
<p><b>Take a Break: </b>Millions of people break up on Facebook each week, changing their relationship status from “in a relationship” to “single.” Research on peoples’ experiences after breakups suggests that offline and online contact, including <a href=""http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/cyber.2012.0125"">seeing an ex-partner’s activities</a>, can make emotional recovery more difficult. To help make this experience easier, we built a tool called <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/notes/kelly-grimaldi/designing-a-product-to-ease-one-of-lifes-difficult-moments/10153139353216581/"">Take a Break</a>, which gives people more centralized control over when they see their ex on Facebook, what their ex can see, and who can see their past posts.</p>
<p><b>Suicide prevention tools:</b> Research shows that <a href=""http://www.jad-journal.com/article/S0165-0327(13)00088-8/fulltext"">social support can help prevent suicide</a>. Facebook is in a unique position to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/fbsafety/videos/1098099763561194/"">connect people in distress</a> with resources that can help. We work with people and organizations around the world to develop <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/fbsafety/photos/a.197686146935898.42079.125459124158601/1041262189244952/"">support options</a> for people posting about suicide on Facebook, including reaching out to a friend, contacting help lines and reading tips about things they can do in that moment. We recently released <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/03/building-a-safer-community-with-new-suicide-prevention-tools/"">suicide prevention support on Facebook Live</a> and introduced<a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/11/getting-our-community-help-in-real-time/""> artificial intelligence to detect suicidal posts </a>even before they are reported. We also connect people more broadly with <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/05/connecting-people-with-mental-health-resources-and-building-a-safer-community/"">mental health resources</a>, including support groups on Facebook.</p>

<p><b>What About Related Areas Like Digital Distraction and the Impact of Technology on Kids?</b></p>
<p>We know that people are concerned about how technology affects our attention spans and relationships, as well as how it affects children in the long run. We agree these are critically important questions, and we all have a lot more to learn.</p>
<p>That’s why we <a href=""https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/12/hard-questions-kids-online/"">recently pledged</a> $1 million toward research to better understand the relationship between media technologies, youth development and well-being. We’re teaming up with experts in the field to look at the impact of mobile technology and social media on kids and teens, as well as how to better support them as they transition through different stages of life.</p>
<p>We’re also making investments to better understand digital distraction and the factors that can pull people away from important face-to-face interactions. Is multitasking hurting our personal relationships? How about our ability to focus? Next year we’ll host a summit with academics and other industry leaders to tackle these issues together.</p>
<p>We don’t have all the answers, but given the prominent role social media now plays in many people’s lives, we want to help elevate the conversation. In the years ahead we’ll be doing more to dig into these questions, share our findings and improve our products. At the end of the day, we’re committed to bringing people together and supporting well-being through meaningful interactions on Facebook.</p>
